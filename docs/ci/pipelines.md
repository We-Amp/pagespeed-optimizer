# CI pipelines

This repository's CI is split into thin **caller** workflows and
**reusable** workflows. The heavy jobs run on a fleet of build runners that
are reachable only through this repository's reusable workflows at
`refs/heads/main` (and `refs/heads/ci-dev`). A pull request therefore cannot
put its own workflow code on a fleet runner: whatever it changes in
`.github/workflows/`, the jobs that reach the fleet are the ones already on
`main`.

## The shape

| Kind | Triggers | Holds | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Caller | `pull_request`, `push`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch` | triggers, `concurrency`, `permissions`, jobs that only `uses:` a reusable workflow `@main` or `@ci-dev`, and at most an aggregate gate job on a hosted label | `ci.yml`, `nightly.yml`, `sweep-queued.yml`, `ci-dev.yml` |
| Reusable | `workflow_call` only | every job, with its `runs-on` | `pipeline-pr.yml`, `pipeline-full.yml`, `pipeline-nightly.yml`, `pipeline-sweep.yml` |

Rules that follow from the shape:

- Concurrency groups live in the callers. A group inside a called workflow
  evaluates the caller's context and can collide or deadlock.
- A caller never names a fleet label. The aggregate gate job (`CI gate`)
  runs inline because it reads `needs.*.result`, which a called workflow
  cannot see; it is pinned to a hosted label.
- Reusable workflows declare `permissions: contents: read`. A job that needs
  more asks for it on the job, and anything that writes to GitHub (issues,
  releases, comments) runs on a hosted runner fed by an artifact, never on a
  fleet runner (see "Report jobs" below). A called workflow can narrow the
  permissions its caller grants but never widen them, so a caller whose
  workflow has a report job grants `issues: write` on the job that calls it.
- Jobs pass files to each other with `actions/upload-artifact` and
  `actions/download-artifact`, or `actions/cache`, never through a path on a
  particular machine. A runner-local fast path is allowed only through the
  runner-environment contract (`docs/ci/runner-environment.md`).

## Tiers

| Tier | Workflow | Runs on | Holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| PR | `pipeline-pr.yml` | every pull request and push to `main` | the hosted checks (daemon build and unit-test slice, Apache RAT, license headers, SBOM drift, release-note gate and the chart, probe and entrypoint checks, the public-tree hygiene gate, the blocking and the report-only dependency scans, the ABI check, the JS/TS unit tests, the release packaging container), and the fleet legs: vendor, Linux build, Linux unit tests, lint (clang-format only on a push to `main`; clang-tidy scoped or skipped by the changed files on a pull request, whole tree on a dispatch), the JS and HTML kernel differentials, the release-config test compile, the Windows build and unit tests, and the path-filtered CSS and JS fuzz smokes. Later changes add the Linux arm64 build and tests |
| Full | `pipeline-full.yml`, called by `ci.yml` and `nightly.yml` (job `full` in both) | push to `main` (unless `FULL_TIER_TRIGGER` is `nightly`), `workflow_dispatch` with `full: true`, a pull request labelled `ci:full`, the scheduled nightly, or a nightly `workflow_dispatch` with `full_tier: true` | its own vendor and Linux x64 build; sanitizers (ASan, TSan); package smokes (Linux x64, Linux arm64, Windows, with a Windows build of the two shipped binaries to feed it); the daemon privilege rigs (three distros on the fleet, one on hosted arm64); HTTP compliance; the async CSS probe markup check; container cache sharing; the Linux arm64 build and unit tests; the whole-tree lint (`lint-full`, for `ci:full` pull requests, dispatches with `full: true` and the nightly, not on a push). See "When the full tier runs" |
| Nightly | `pipeline-nightly.yml`, called by `nightly.yml` (which also calls the full tier as `full`) | `nightly.yml`: daily at 04:00 UTC and on dispatch | the macOS build, unit tests and package smoke; the periodic vendor and optimized builds (x64 on the fleet, arm64 hosted); the stress, production, real-world and end-to-end lanes on both architectures; the x64 privilege-rig soak; the rendered async CSS probe; CSS fuzzing (nightly, and a manual shadow lane); the nightly image leg of the dependency scan |
| Sweep | `pipeline-sweep.yml` | `sweep-queued.yml`: hourly and on dispatch | cancels runs that wait for a runner nobody serves (see "The queued-run sweep") |

The `ci:full` label is read when a pull request run starts (open, push,
reopen). After adding the label, push or re-run the workflow to get the
full tier.

The full tier's Linux build, ASan and TSan jobs take their Bazel flags from
the `ci-build`, `ci-asan` and `ci-tsan` configs in `.bazelrc`. Those configs
are the one definition CI and the bisect (`tools/ci/bisect-job.sh`) share.
Only the remote-cache and jobs choice (`BAZEL_CONFIG`),
`--nocache_test_results` and the target patterns stay on the job's command
line; docker flags stay in the workflow.

### When the full tier runs

Two callers name it `full`, so its checks read `full / <job name>` in both:

- `ci.yml`: a `workflow_dispatch` with `full: true` (every release
  candidate), a pull request labelled `ci:full`, and a push to `main`.
- `nightly.yml`: every scheduled nightly, and a nightly `workflow_dispatch`
  with `full_tier: true` (boolean, default `false`) on `main`. That dispatch
  is the make-up path for a missed or late night; a dispatch on any other
  ref never reaches it. It shares the `nightly` concurrency group, so it never
  starts while another nightly is pending or running. A release-candidate
  nightly dispatch leaves `full_tier` off, because the candidate's `CI`
  dispatch with `full: true` covers the full tier. The call grants
  `actions: read` and `contents: read`, the same as the push tier's call.

The repository variable `FULL_TIER_TRIGGER` decides the push: unset, or any
value other than `nightly`, runs the full tier on every push to `main`.
With `nightly`, a push runs it only when the pushed range changes the full
tier's own definition: `.github/workflows/pipeline-full.yml`, `nightly.yml`,
`pipeline-nightly.yml`, `ci.yml` (it holds this trigger, so a change to it
proves itself at once), anything under `.github/actions/`, every
`tools/ci/` file `pipeline-full.yml` names (as `tools/ci/<file>` or
`tools\ci\<file>`), and the `tools/ci/` files those files name in turn
(one level). The hosted `Full tier scope` job (`full-scope` in `ci.yml`)
decides it with `tools/ci/full_tier_scope.sh`, read from `main`, never
from the tree under test, and publishes `full_tier_change`. The range is
not the last commit: it starts at the head of the last push run of `CI` on
`main` in which `Full tier scope` succeeded (`tools/ci/push_range_base.sh
--require-job`, which reads the Actions runs and jobs API with
`actions: read`), because GitHub replaces pending push runs in a merge burst
and a full-tier change in a replaced run must still be seen. The full tier
is skipped on a push only when `full-scope` succeeded and printed `false`;
a failed or undecided scope job, no usable base or an API failure runs it.
`CI gate` accepts `full-scope` and `full` as skipped. Neither `Full tier
scope` nor any `full / ` job is a required check.

### Bisecting a red full-tier job

`tools/ci/bisect-job.sh` bisects a red `linux-asan`, `linux-tsan` (test
bisect) or `linux-build` (build bisect) on one Linux build host. Other
full-tier jobs are out of its scope. Per-repository values (job names,
container flags and environment, services, the vendor command) are in
`tools/ci/bisect-job-table.sh`; `tools/ci/test_bisect_job.sh` checks them
against `pipeline-full.yml`, so a workflow change that is not mirrored there
fails CI.

```bash
export BISECT_ROOT=/absolute/path/for/bisect/runs   # required, never defaulted
tools/ci/bisect-job.sh start --job linux-asan --bad <sha> --good <sha> \
  --run <run-id> --repo <clone url or path>         # prints <id>, returns at once
tools/ci/bisect-job.sh status <id>                  # state, last log lines, exit
tools/ci/bisect-job.sh resume <id>                  # continue an interrupted run
```

Host prerequisites: `docker`, `git`, `gh` (authenticated), `flock` and
`setsid` (util-linux), `nice` (and `ionice` where present), and `bazel`
(bazelisk) for vendoring.

`--targets-file <file>` (one label per line) replaces `--run`. `--cpus`,
`--memory-gb`, `--runs-per-test` and `--remote-cache-url` (read-only use)
are optional. The run writes `BISECT_ROOT/<id>/{state,log,result.json,exit}`.
`result.json` has `status` (`culprit`, `inconclusive`, `env-dependent`,
`external-drift-or-stale-good`, `no-targets`, `too-many-targets`),
`first_bad`, `skips`, `targets`, `timeout_only`, `rebuilt_images`, `steps`,
`bad`, `good` and `job`. `start` and `resume` exit 0 when launched, 2 when
refused, 3 when another bisect holds the lock.

How it decides:

- The targets come from the failed job's log (`gh run view --job <id>
  --log-failed`, or when that gives nothing the job logs API with `gh api
  --allow-escape-sequences`) through `tools/ci/failing_targets.sh`. No target,
  or more than 10 (`BISECT_MAX_TARGETS`), means no bisect.
- The bad endpoint must fail and the good one pass first (otherwise
  `env-dependent` or `external-drift-or-stale-good`). Then `git bisect start
  --first-parent` and `git bisect run`.
- A step is bad when a recorded target fails the same way (a compile failure
  of a recorded target counts in a test bisect too), good when all recorded
  targets pass or build, and skipped for anything else: a commit whose
  `.bazelrc` predates the job's `ci-*` config, a vendoring or image failure, a
  build error in another target.
- Each step uses the commit's own `.bazelrc` config, vendored tree (kept per
  vendor key under `BISECT_ROOT/vendor/`) and content-hashed dev image (built
  only when the host lacks it; a rebuild is listed in `rebuilt_images`), with
  `--nocache_test_results` and a private `--disk_cache`. MOD's redis and
  memcached run on the run's own network under their short names as network
  aliases.
- Disk: each step copies the vendored tree into the work tree, and the
  script never prunes `BISECT_ROOT`; operators prune it.

Host safety contract:

- Every container and network name starts with the run id
  (`bisect-<repo>-<job>-<utc>-<pid>`) and is recorded before it is created.
  Cleanup removes only those names. Nothing else is stopped, removed or
  pruned, no image is retagged or removed, and no process is signalled.
- `BISECT_ROOT` must be absolute and outside any `actions-runner*/_work`
  tree (checked on the resolved path before anything is created). One bisect runs per host (`flock` on `BISECT_ROOT/.lock`).
- A step container runs with `--cpu-shares 128` and `--cpus`/`--memory` caps
  (defaults: a quarter of the host's CPUs, at most 16; 2 GiB per CPU, at
  least 16 GiB), and Bazel `--jobs` equals the CPU cap. Service containers
  get a small fixed cap. Host-side work (the docker client, vendoring, image
  builds) runs under `nice` (and `ionice` where present); that does not carry
  into a container, so the share inside comes from the caps alone.
- Host Bazel (vendoring) runs with `HOME` and `--output_user_root` (the
  install base) under `BISECT_ROOT/<id>`. A `PATH` shim keeps the vendor
  script's own `--output_base`, records it and shuts that server down when
  each call returns; the exit trap shuts down any recorded one that is left
  and removes only the trees under `BISECT_ROOT/<id>`.
- `resume` first removes the containers the earlier worker recorded.

## Runner routing

Every fleet job chooses its runner from the event, never from inputs. A pull
request from a fork, or from Dependabot, runs on a GitHub-hosted runner;
everything else runs on a fleet class label. The expression, copied
verbatim into every fleet job:

```yaml
runs-on: ${{ (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && (github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == true || github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]')) && 'ubuntu-latest' || 'fleet-heavy' }}
```

The fleet class is one of `fleet-heavy`, `fleet-light`, `fleet-windows`,
`fleet-iis`. Windows jobs use `windows-2022` as the hosted side.

### The kill switch

`FLEET_ENABLED` is a repository variable. Unset or `true` means the fleet is
in use; `false` is the kill switch.

The PR, full and nightly tiers use the switch routing expression, copied
verbatim into every fleet job that has a hosted twin. It sends the job to the
hosted side for a fork or Dependabot pull request and also while the switch
is off:

```yaml
runs-on: ${{ (vars.FLEET_ENABLED == 'false' || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && (github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == true || github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'))) && 'ubuntu-latest' || 'fleet-heavy' }}
```

Such a job carries no `if:` guard (it always runs, on one side or the other),
except a path filter alone (`needs.changes.outputs.<name> == 'true'`) or, on
`vendor` only, the fleet-scope guard `needs.changes.outputs.fleet == 'true'`. Jobs
with no hosted twin keep the plain routing expression and a fleet-only guard
whose `FLEET_ENABLED` term is `!= 'false'`: they are skipped, not failed,
while the switch is off, and a `fleet-off-notice` job in each tier says so in
an annotation and the job summary.

To flip it: Settings, Secrets and variables, Actions, Variables, set
`FLEET_ENABLED` to `false` (or `gh variable set FLEET_ENABLED --body false
-R We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer`); set it back to `true` to go back (do not delete it: the release lanes still test for `true`). It
is read when a run starts, so re-run a run that began before the change. The
hosted legs run without the hub and the remote cache and are slower; the
fleet-only legs are skipped, and the CI gate accepts those skips.

The release lanes do not use the switch routing expression. They keep the
plain routing expression, the original guards (`FLEET_ENABLED == 'true'`) and
their hosted twins; see "Release lanes: hosted twins".

#### The plain guards

A fleet job routed by the plain expression (the release lanes, and the jobs
without a hosted twin) carries one of these guards, verbatim, as its `if:`:

```yaml
if: ${{ vars.FLEET_ENABLED == 'true' || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && (github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == true || github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]')) }}
```

While the variable is unset (or anything but `true`), these jobs are skipped
for same-repository events and still run on hosted runners for fork and
Dependabot pull requests, which need no fleet. Clearing it is the kill switch
for the release lanes' fleet jobs, which then run their hosted twins.

Two more guards exist for jobs that cannot fall back to a hosted runner, and
the gate accepts exactly these three. **Fleet only** is for a job that mounts
the container socket, runs privileged containers or needs a real Linux
kernel: a fork or Dependabot pull request skips it.

```yaml
if: ${{ vars.FLEET_ENABLED == 'true' && !(github.event_name == 'pull_request' && (github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == true || github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]')) }}
```

The manual shadow lanes keep the dispatch-only guard below with `== 'true'`, so they
are skipped while the variable is unset or `false`.

**Dispatch only** is for a manual lane; a dispatch is never a fork pull
request.

```yaml
if: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && vars.FLEET_ENABLED == 'true' }}
```

The PR, full and nightly tiers write the fleet-only guard with the first term
`vars.FLEET_ENABLED != 'false'` (unset means on); the gate accepts both
spellings. A job that needs more conditions (for example a path filter) appends them in
a later change together with a matching gate rule; the gate rejects any
fleet job whose `if:` is not exactly one of the three guards. A job that runs
on a hosted label only (hosted arm64, macOS, report jobs) carries no guard.

### Hosted side: degraded mode

Every fleet job must also run on a hosted runner: no hub, no remote cache,
no host paths. Anything host-specific is read from the runner environment
(`docs/ci/runner-environment.md`) and used only when set. When none of it is
set the job runs slower, never fails for that reason. In `pipeline-pr.yml`:

- **vendor** decides a distribution channel: `hub` when the runner provides
  a local vendor directory or a hub, `cache` otherwise. On the cache channel
  `vendor/` passes to the consumer jobs through `actions/cache`, keyed on the
  vendor manifest (`MODULE.bazel`, `.bazelversion`, `bazel/**`,
  `third_party/**`); a dependency bump re-vendors once.
- **Linux Build** and **Linux Unit Tests** use the remote Bazel cache only
  when `BAZEL_CACHE_HOST` is set (`--config=ci`); otherwise they build with
  `--config=docker` and no cache. The build bundle always goes to
  `actions/upload-artifact` (retention 3 days) and the unit tests download it.
- **Kernel differentials**, the **release-config test compile** and the
  **fuzz smokes** follow the same two rules: the remote cache only when
  `BAZEL_CACHE_HOST` is set, and the dev image built in the job when the
  runner has none. The differentials' floor ratchet reads the public
  `We-Amp/mod_pagespeed` repository, and only when a pin floor moves.
- **Windows Build** and **Windows Unit Tests** take their tools from `PATH`
  or from `CI_WIN_TOOLS_DIR`. On the hub channel a runner with a vendor
  tarball (`CI_WIN_VENDOR_DIR`, or a fetch from `CI_HUB_SSH`) extracts it
  over the checkout; otherwise Bazel fetches the dependencies itself. The
  remote cache is used only when `BAZEL_REMOTE_CACHE_URL` is set. The build
  bundle goes to `actions/upload-artifact` (`ci-artifacts-win-x64`). The
  hosted Windows build time has not been measured; if it proves too slow, the
  fallback is to run these two jobs on the fleet only.
- **Lint** keeps its Bazel state in a per-runner cache directory under the
  runner's home, which persists on a fleet runner and is empty on a hosted
  one. No credential enters the lint containers.
- **Lint scope on a pull request.** A changed `.cc` file is linted; a changed
  header lints the `.cc` files that include it, directly or through other
  headers (`tools/ci/lint-scope-expand.sh`, run inside the lint container and
  limited to the files in `compile_commands.json`). A changed `.cc` file with
  no compilation-database entry fails the job; a dependent of a header that is
  not in the database is listed in the log and skipped. When the changed files
  reach no translation unit at all, clang-tidy is skipped with a log line; it
  never falls back to the whole tree. A change to the clang-tidy configuration
  (`.clang-tidy`, `test/.clang-tidy`, `lib/image/generated/.clang-tidy`), the
  lint image (`docker/Dockerfile`, `docker/Dockerfile.lint`), the
  compile-database recipe (`tools/ci/lint-compile-commands.sh`, the root
  `BUILD`), the expander, `MODULE.bazel` or `.bazelrc` lints the whole tree,
  because only the whole tree can show the effect of such a change. The path
  list is `LINT_TRIGGER_PATHS` in the "Compute lint scope" step. The
  whole-tree lint runs in the nightly and on `workflow_dispatch`; a pull
  request that changes a lint trigger file also lints the whole tree. The self-test is
  `tools/ci/test_lint_scope_expand.sh`.
- **Static analyzer scope.** The clang static analyzer (`clang-analyzer-*`)
  runs on `lib/` and `src/` only and is turned off for `test/` in
  `test/.clang-tidy`. Measured reason: it accounts for about 96% of clang-tidy
  CPU on the test tree (the largest test unit took 33.6 minutes
  single-threaded with it and 100 seconds without it), and the test tree is
  88% of a whole-tree lint. `test/.clang-tidy` is itself a lint trigger file
  (listed above), so a change to it lints the whole tree.

### Release lanes: hosted twins

A release cannot wait for the fleet. In the release pipelines
(`pipeline-release-optimizer.yml`, `pipeline-release-nuget.yml`) every
fleet job has a hosted twin: the same steps (shared through a YAML anchor),
a hosted label, and `if: ${{ vars.FLEET_ENABLED != 'true' }}`. Exactly one
of each pair runs, so clearing `FLEET_ENABLED` moves a release to hosted
runners instead of skipping it. A job that consumes the output of a pair
names both in `needs:` and runs when either succeeded. Release lanes pass
every file between jobs as workflow artifacts; they use no hub.

### Path-filtered jobs

The `changes` job (hosted) diffs a pull request against its base and
publishes one boolean per filter (`css`, `js`). A fleet job that depends on a
filter narrows the guard with `&& needs.changes.outputs.<name> == 'true'`:

```yaml
if: ${{ (vars.FLEET_ENABLED == 'true' || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && (github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == true || github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'))) && needs.changes.outputs.css == 'true' }}
```

Outside a pull request every filter is false. The workflow-shape gate accepts
the guard either verbatim or in exactly this narrowed form.

## Artifacts

Jobs pass files through `actions/upload-artifact` and
`actions/download-artifact`. Artifact names are unique within a workflow run,
and the caller runs the PR tier and the full tier in one run, so each tier
prefixes its names: the PR tier uses none, the full tier `full-`, the nightly
tier `nightly-`. A build bundle is the directory `.ci-artifacts` (binaries,
`metadata.json`, `checksums.sha256`); a consumer downloads it to a directory
and hands the parent to `tools/ci/stage-artifacts.sh`, which validates it.
Retention is three days for bundles and evidence.

## Report jobs

A job that files or closes an issue never runs on the fleet. The fleet job
uploads a small artifact (the findings text, plus a `lane-ran` marker file
that says the lane reached a verdict) and a hosted `report` job with
`issues: write` downloads it and runs `tools/sbom/post-findings-issue.sh`.
Without the marker, or without the artifact, the report job leaves the issue
alone, so a failure before the lane ran cannot close a live issue. Only a run
on the default branch changes the issue; a branch dispatch is a dry run.
The gate enforces the split (rule f): every reusable workflow declares a
top-level `permissions:` block with no write access, and a write permission
(quoted or not) is allowed only on a job with a hosted `runs-on`. The report
jobs check out `main` for the tools they run, because they hold a write token.

### The nightly-red issue

`nightly.yml` ends with the hosted job `nightly-red` (`Nightly full-tier
report`): `needs: [full]`, runs whenever `full` was not skipped,
`actions: read`, `contents: read` and `issues: write`, no secret. It runs
`tools/ci/nightly_red_report.sh` from `main`. The caller sees one result
for `full`, and a `continue-on-error` job never turns it red, so the script
reads the run's own job list and judges each `full / <job>` itself:

- **skipped** never counts as green, and is never listed as failed either;
  the issue names skipped jobs on a line of their own.
- **green** is `success`, plus a success of every step named for the job in
  `RUNTIME_STEP_CHECKS` (`<job name>=<step name>` lines). This repository
  leaves it empty.
- **failed** is everything else (failure, cancelled, timed out, a green job
  whose checked step did not succeed).

When a job failed, the script opens one issue titled `Nightly full tier red`
with the label `nightly-red` (created on first use), or comments on the open
one and replaces its body. Per failed job the body lists the job, the SHA,
the failing targets from its log (`tools/ci/failing_targets.sh`; `none
extracted` when the log names none, `timeout-only` when every one timed
out, `from the whole job log` when the failed-steps log was not available
and the whole job log was read instead, so a line from a retried step can
appear), the last completed run in which that job was green and the commit
count since, and a marker line `<!-- nightly-red-job: <job name> -->`. A
`Skipped` line lists the skipped jobs, or `none`. The last green is searched
in the completed runs on `main` of `nightly.yml`, of `ci.yml`'s
`workflow_dispatch` and of `ci.yml`'s push, created before this run (the
run's own creation time, which a re-run keeps), newest first, whatever their
event (a scheduled night, a `full_tier` or `full: true` dispatch, a push), so
a missed night does not hide it. `REPORT_MAX_LOOKUPS` (12) counts only runs
that ran a `full / ` job, so a day of push runs without the full tier does
not use it up; `REPORT_MAX_API_CALLS` (40) caps the jobs calls of the search.
When none is found the body says `no green within <N> completed full-tier
runs`, with `(API call ceiling reached)` when the ceiling ended the search.
The body names jobs, SHAs, targets and run links only.

When no job failed, the open issue is closed, with a comment, once every job
named by a marker line is green in this run. **A re-run never closes it:** on
`GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT` 2 or later the script only comments, because a re-run
that goes green is a flake signal and not evidence of a fix. An API failure
fails the job, so a reporter that could not report is visible. A run on any
ref other than `main` is a dry run that prints what it would write.
`tools/ci/test_nightly_red_report.sh` and `tools/ci/test_failing_targets.sh`
(in the `Public-tree hygiene gate` job) pin this behaviour.

## The queued-run sweep

A job whose runner label nothing serves (a retired label, or a fleet class
whose runners are not registered while `FLEET_ENABLED` is on) queues for days
instead of failing. With `FLEET_ENABLED` off the fleet guard skips the job, so
nothing queues. `sweep-queued.yml` runs hourly on a hosted runner and calls
`pipeline-sweep.yml`, which runs `tools/ci/sweep-queued-runs.sh`: it lists runs
in `queued` or `waiting` status whose latest attempt started more than 30
minutes ago (`run_started_at`, so a re-run of an old run is not stale; the
script falls back to `created_at` only when that field is empty), keeps any
run with a job that has a runner and any run of a workflow on the skip list
(`Release` by default, because a run that waits for a manual approval looks the
same), and cancels the rest with one log line each. `--dry-run` only logs.

The threshold is a repository variable: set `SWEEP_MAX_AGE_MINUTES` (a whole
number of minutes) to override the 30 minute default. Raise it when a busy
runner class legitimately keeps whole runs queued for longer, for example
behind the long nightly stress legs. The logic is tested against a fake `gh` by
`tools/ci/test_sweep_queued_runs.sh`, which the sweep job runs first.

## Merge-queue runs

A `merge_group` run is routed to the fleet unconditionally, so a fork or
Dependabot pull request in a merge group would build its code on a fleet
runner. The `changes` job (hosted) therefore starts with the step `Refuse fork
and Dependabot PRs in the merge queue`, which runs only on `merge_group`. It
resolves every pull request in the group, taking the last `(#N)` of each
commit subject in `base_sha..head_sha` plus the number in the group's
`head_ref`, and looks each one up with `gh api` (5 tries, 2, 4, 8 and 16 s
apart). It refuses (the job fails) when a pull request comes from a fork, is
authored by `dependabot[bot]`, has lost its head repository, or has a head
repository other than this one (compared case-insensitively); when the range
is empty, a commit subject has no `(#N)` or the `head_ref` cannot be parsed;
or when a lookup still fails after the last try. `vendor` needs `changes`, and
every other fleet job needs `vendor` or `changes`, so a refusal skips the
whole fleet and `CI gate` goes red.

The classifier is `tools/ci/queue_fork_guard.sh`. The step reads it from
`origin/main` and pipes it to `bash`; it never runs the copy in the
queued tree, and a script missing on the default branch fails the step. The
workflow-shape gate (`queue-guard-reads-default-branch`) requires the step in
the `changes` job, restricts its `run:` block to that read (plus `set -euo
pipefail` and the default-branch fetch) and rejects any other read of the
script in a workflow file.
`tools/ci/test_queue_fork_guard.sh` covers the classifier against a fake `gh`.

The PR-number rule depends on the queue's **squash** merge method: one squash
commit per pull request, its subject ending in `(#N)`. A different method
(merge commits or rebase) must change the classifier first; a group without
that shape is refused.

**Event guard.** A queued tree can change the caller `ci.yml` to call any
other allow-listed fleet pipeline, and it can also produce `push` and
`workflow_dispatch` events of its own (the queue pushes a temporary
`gh-readonly-queue/` branch; a queued job with a write token can dispatch a
workflow). Every one of those pipelines therefore opens with a hosted job
`event-guard` that refuses: any event outside the pipeline's allowed list
(`merge_group` is allowed nowhere but `pipeline-pr.yml`); a ref under
`refs/heads/gh-readonly-queue/` or outside the pipeline's allowed refs; a
`workflow_dispatch` made by `github-actions[bot]` (a dispatch with a workflow
token); and a pull request from a fork or from another repository. The allowed
events and refs are `pipeline-full.yml` (events `push`, `workflow_dispatch`, `pull_request`, `schedule`; refs `refs/heads/main`, `refs/heads/ci-dev`, `refs/pull/*/merge`: `ci.yml` runs it for a push to `main`, a dispatch with `full: true` and the `ci:full` label, and `nightly.yml` for the scheduled nightly and a `full_tier` dispatch), `pipeline-nightly.yml` (`schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`; `refs/heads/main`), and `pipeline-release-optimizer.yml` and `pipeline-release-nuget.yml` (`push`, `workflow_dispatch`; `refs/tags/*` and `refs/heads/main` for dry runs). Every fleet job reaches `event-guard` through `needs`,
so a refusal skips the whole fleet. The workflow-shape gate (`event-guard`)
pins the job text, the per-pipeline lists and the edges, scans every workflow file that has a fleet `runs-on` (not a fixed list), and rejects a job between the guard and a fleet job that can still run after the guard failed. Job keys (`if`, `needs`, `runs-on`, `continue-on-error`, `uses`) are matched quoted or with whitespace before the colon. Each job's `if:` is normalised first (folded, literal and plain multi-line forms joined, where a plain value continues on every line indented more than its key and a `#`-led line inside a block scalar is content; lowercased, whitespace collapsed, the space between a function name and its `(` removed). Then, for every job on a `needs` path between `event-guard` and a fleet job (and the fleet jobs themselves, unless the routing-guard rule pins their `if:`), an `if:` that contains `always(`, `failure(`, `cancelled(`, `success(` (unless the whole `if:` is a bare `success()`), `||`, `!` (a negation anywhere, so `!=` and `!= true` too) or `== false` must be exactly `needs.event-guard.result == 'success' && (<inner>)`, optionally inside `${{ }}`, where the parentheses around `<inner>` are one balanced group (parentheses inside string literals do not count) and `<inner>` does not mention `event-guard`; the job must also need `event-guard`, and a block scalar holding the condition must strip its final newline (`|-` or `>-`), since a kept newline is text around `${{ }}`. Otherwise the gate rejects the job by name. Because `!` covers `!=`, an `if:` such as `${{ needs.event-guard.result != 'failure' }}` or `${{ vars.FLEET_ENABLED != 'true' }}` on such a job is rejected as well, although it would be safe; write it as `${{ needs.event-guard.result == 'success' && (vars.FLEET_ENABLED != 'true') }}`. Any other `if:` is accepted as today (GitHub adds `success()` implicitly unless the expression names a status function). The gate also refuses, in every workflow's `jobs:` section, a YAML anchor or alias on a job or on a job-level key other than `steps:` and `env:`, and any `<<:` merge key, because it reads the text and cannot resolve them (anchored step lists and env maps stay allowed).

The `changes` job of `pipeline-pr.yml` refuses the same two cases for itself,
because a queued tree's caller can also reach that pipeline with a `push` on the
queue's temporary branch: before the fork guard step, `Refuse pushes that are
not on the default branch` accepts a push only on `refs/heads/<default>` or
`refs/heads/ci-dev`, and `Refuse dispatches made with a workflow token` refuses
a dispatch made by `github-actions[bot]`. The shape gate
(`queue-guard-reads-default-branch`) requires these two steps and the fork guard
step, in this order, as the first steps after the checkout, each in exactly
this text.

This narrows the merge-queue boundary; it does not close it. The policy stays:
no fork or Dependabot pull request is added to the merge queue. The `@ci-dev`
allow-list entries stay. Pushing `ci-dev` from a `main`-based branch gives its
copies of `pipeline-pr.yml` and `pipeline-full.yml` the queue fork guard and
this guard, but that alone does not close the `@ci-dev` path: it stays open
until the default workflow token permission is read-only and the `ci-dev`
branch is restricted so that only administrators can update it (or the
`@ci-dev` allow-list entries are removed), and `ci-dev` has been pushed again
from the default branch. Until then the policy above applies.

## CI_SCOPE: the fleet scope of the PR tier

The `changes` job of `pipeline-pr.yml` decides, in its step `Decide the fleet
scope`, whether the fleet legs of the PR tier run. It publishes two outputs,
`fleet` and `heavy` (equal for now); `vendor` runs only when `fleet` is
`true`, and every other fleet leg needs `vendor` (the fuzz smokes, which need
only `changes`, never run outside a pull request or a merge group), so
`fleet=false` skips them all. The hosted jobs of the PR tier and the whole
full tier run as before.

- `merge_group` and `workflow_dispatch` always run the whole PR tier. The step
  decides them inline, whatever `CI_SCOPE` says, so a merge group and the
  release candidate dispatch (`full: true`) never skip a fleet leg.
- For every other event the step reads `tools/ci/pr_tier_scope.sh` from
  `origin/main` with `git show`, never from the tree under test, and runs
  that copy. A missing script, a failing script or any output other than
  exactly the two lines `fleet=<true|false>` and `heavy=<true|false>` runs the
  whole tier and leaves a warning.
- The repository variable `CI_SCOPE`, lowercased, sets the level. Unset,
  `full` or any value the script does not know runs everything. `push`,
  `pr-build` and `pr` turn on the push rule.
- **The push rule.** A push to `main` skips the fleet legs when the merge
  queue already proved the same commit and the commit does not change the PR
  tier itself. Proof: the commit has a completed, successful GitHub Actions
  check suite on a `gh-readonly-queue/` branch
  (`gh api repos/<repo>/commits/<sha>/check-suites?app_id=15368`, up to 3
  tries, 2 and 4 s apart; an empty or unparseable answer after the last try
  counts as no proof). A change to the PR tier: any path under
  `.github/actions/` or `tools/ci/`, or `.github/workflows/pipeline-pr.yml` or
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, in the pushed commit; a commit without a parent
  counts as one. The callers grant `checks: read` to the `pr` job for the
  lookup.
- **Log lines.** The script writes one line
  `fleet scope: event=<event> scope=<level> fleet=<bool> heavy=<bool> reason=<text>`
  and, on every push whatever the level,
  `shadow: would_skip=<bool> proof=<true|false|error> pipeline_change=<bool>`:
  what the push rule decides for this commit, so the rule can be measured
  with `CI_SCOPE` unset before it acts. When the commit changes the PR tier,
  the proof is not looked up and the line says `proof=false`.
- **Rollback.** Set the variable back:
  `gh variable set CI_SCOPE --body full --repo We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer` (or
  delete it). The next run takes it; nothing else changes.
- **Coverage on a skipped push.** The fleet legs ran on the same commit in the
  merge queue, so a skipped push loses no check of the merged tree, with one
  difference: a push to `main` no longer runs a whole-tree clang-tidy. The PR
  tier's `lint` computes its scope per event (scoped or none by the changed
  files on a pull request or in the merge queue, with the dependents of a
  changed header included, and the whole tree on a `workflow_dispatch`) and on a push runs
  clang-format only. The full tier's `lint-full` runs for a `ci:full` pull
  request, for a dispatch with `full: true` and in the nightly, and is
  skipped on a push. The whole-tree lint for `main` is that job in the
  scheduled nightly's call of the full tier, `full / Lint (whole tree)`
  (see "When the full tier runs"); the nightly tier has no twin of it. TSan,
  ASan, the privilege rigs and the arm64 legs run with the full tier (see
  "When the full tier runs" for `FULL_TIER_TRIGGER`).
  The hosted checks of the PR tier (Apache
  RAT, license headers and SBOM drift, the blocking and the report-only
  dependency scans and the others) are not fleet legs and still run on every
  push. `tools/ci/test_pr_tier_scope.sh` covers the script against a fake
  `gh`, and the workflow-shape gate (`fleet-scope`) pins the step.

## Required checks

`ci.yml` is a thin caller, so a check from a called workflow is named
`<caller job> / <job name>`, and the required checks are
`pr / Build daemon & unit-test slice (ubuntu)`,
`pr / License audit (Apache RAT)`, `pr / License Headers + SBOM Drift`,
`pr / Public-tree hygiene gate`, `pr / Blocking Dep Scan (npm + cargo)`,
`pr / ABI Compatibility (lib/pagespeed C API)`, `pr / JS/TS Unit Tests`,
`pr / Release Packaging Container`, the fleet legs once `FLEET_ENABLED` is on
(`pr / Linux Build`, `pr / Linux Unit Tests`, `pr / Lint (clang-tidy +
clang-format)`, `pr / JS Kernel Differential (vendored goldens)`,
`pr / HTML Parse Differential (vendored goldens)`, `pr / Release-config test
compile`, `pr / Windows Build`, `pr / Windows Unit Tests`), and `CI gate`.

Not listed individually: `pr / Dependency Scan (report-only)` (it never
fails the build) and the two fuzz smokes (`pr / CSS fuzz smoke (deterministic
oracle replay)`, `pr / JS fuzz smoke (deterministic oracle replay)`), which
are skipped on a pull request that does not touch their paths. The aggregate
`CI gate` treats `skipped` as fine and fails on any other non-success
result, so it covers all three.

## Trying a pipeline change on the fleet: `ci-dev`

A change to a reusable workflow does not reach the fleet from its own pull
request (the callers pin `@main`). To exercise it before merge:

1. Push the change to the `ci-dev` branch:
   `git push --force origin HEAD:ci-dev`. Push `ci-dev` only from a branch
   based on the current `main`, so it carries the queue and event guards.
2. Dispatch the `CI (ci-dev)` workflow (`ci-dev.yml`) from the Actions tab
   or with `gh workflow run ci-dev.yml --ref ci-dev`. It calls
   `pipeline-pr.yml@ci-dev`. Use `--ref ci-dev`: the event guard of the
   full-tier pipeline accepts a dispatch only on `main` or `ci-dev`.
   To run the full tier as well, set the `full` input:
   `gh workflow run ci-dev.yml --ref ci-dev -f full=true` (or tick `full`
   in the Actions tab). The `full` job then calls `pipeline-full.yml@ci-dev`.
3. When it is green, merge the pull request as usual.

The `ci-dev` workflow is latest-wins: its concurrency group cancels the run in
flight when a newer one is dispatched, so only the newest dispatch finishes.
The `ci-dev` branch is shared and disposable; whoever pushes it last owns
the next dispatch.

## The workflow-shape gate

`tools/ci/check-workflow-shape.sh` runs in the `Public-tree hygiene gate`
job and fails the build when the shape breaks:

- **(a)** no workflow uses `pull_request_target`;
- **(b)** a workflow with any trigger other than `workflow_call` is a caller:
  its jobs only `uses:` `We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer/.github/workflows/<file>.yml@main`
  or `@ci-dev`, with no `runs-on` or `steps`, except an aggregate gate job
  on a hosted label. Files listed in `tools/ci/workflow-shape-allowlist.txt`
  (with a reason each) are exempt from this rule only;
- **(c)** no local reusable-workflow reference (`uses: ./.github/workflows/...`);
- **(d)** in a reusable workflow every `runs-on` is a hosted label
  (`ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `windows-2022`,
  `macos-15`, `macos-latest`), exactly the plain routing expression with a
  fleet class, or the switch routing expression; a job routed by the plain
  expression carries one of the three fleet guards verbatim (the general form
  optionally narrowed by a `changes` path filter, see above), and a job routed
  by the switch expression carries none;
- **(e)** `.github/` and `tools/ci/` carry no LAN address literals, no
  `.home` names, no `:9090`, no `self-hosted` and none of the retired runner
  label words;
- **(f)** in a reusable workflow a `write` permission (workflow or job level)
  is allowed only on a job with a hosted `runs-on`;
- **(queue-guard-reads-default-branch)** in `pipeline-pr.yml`: the `changes`
  job holds the merge-queue guard step as the third of three fixed steps
  after the checkout step (after the push-ref and token-dispatch refusal
  steps; the checkout sets no `env:`), with fixed keys (compared unquoted), `if:`,
  `run:` block (the classifier is read from `origin/${DEFAULT_BRANCH}` with
  `git show`) and only the guard's own env keys; no other line names the
  script in any spelling, and the job has no glob, `find`, `source` or
  `GITHUB_ENV` write under `tools/ci/`; `BASH_ENV`, `PATH`, `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE` and `GIT_CONFIG*` are not
  set at workflow level or in that job; `vendor` has `needs: changes` and
  either no `if:` or exactly `if: ${{ needs.changes.outputs.fleet == 'true' }}`
  (see "Merge-queue runs");
- **(fleet-scope)** in `pipeline-pr.yml`: the `changes` job holds the step
  `Decide the fleet scope` right after the merge-queue guard step (so before
  the path-filter diff), in exactly its spec text (comment and blank lines
  aside): it decides `merge_group` and `workflow_dispatch` inline and reads
  `tools/ci/pr_tier_scope.sh` from `origin/${DEFAULT_BRANCH}`. The job
  publishes `fleet` and `heavy` from that step, and no other line names the
  script (see "CI_SCOPE: the fleet scope of the PR tier");
- **(event-guard)** a reusable workflow with a fleet job holds the hosted
  `event-guard` job in its spec form, with the per-pipeline `ALLOWED` and
  `ALLOWED_REFS` lists (for `pipeline-full.yml`: `push workflow_dispatch
  pull_request schedule`, and no other event), and every fleet job reaches it
  through `needs` (see "Merge-queue runs");
- **(yaml-alias)** no YAML anchor, alias or `<<:` merge key on a job or a job-level
  key other than `steps:` and `env:`.

The gate is line-oriented: `runs-on` and the guard must each fit on one
line. Fixtures live in `tools/ci/testdata/workflow-shape/`; run
`tools/ci/test_check_workflow_shape.sh` after changing the gate.

## Runner group policy entries

The fleet runner group admits only the workflows listed in its
"selected workflows" policy; a job from any other workflow file or ref
queues and never starts. The entries, one per reusable workflow that can
reach the fleet:

```text
We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer/.github/workflows/pipeline-pr.yml@refs/heads/main
We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer/.github/workflows/pipeline-full.yml@refs/heads/main
We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer/.github/workflows/pipeline-full.yml@refs/heads/ci-dev
We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer/.github/workflows/pipeline-nightly.yml@refs/heads/main
We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer/.github/workflows/pipeline-release-optimizer.yml@refs/heads/main
We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer/.github/workflows/pipeline-release-nuget.yml@refs/heads/main
We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer/.github/workflows/pipeline-pr.yml@refs/heads/ci-dev
```

`pipeline-release-smoke.yml` runs on hosted runners only and needs no
entry. Callers (`ci.yml`, `nightly.yml`, `ci-dev.yml`, `release.yml`,
`release-smoke.yml`) never get one. Add an entry in the same change that
gives a reusable workflow its first fleet job.
