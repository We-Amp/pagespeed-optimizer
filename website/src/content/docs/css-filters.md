## Overview

mod_pagespeed 2.1 includes filters for CSS minification, combining, inlining, import flattening, and critical CSS extraction. Several CSS filters are CoreFilters and run by default. The remaining filters can be enabled individually or through OptimizeForBandwidth mode.

## IIS syntax

On IIS, use the same filter names with the `pagespeed` prefix in `pagespeed.config` (no semicolons):

```text
pagespeed EnableFilters rewrite_css,combine_css
pagespeed CssInlineMaxBytes 4096
```

See [IIS configuration](/docs/iis-configuration/) for the full file format reference.

## Filter details

### rewrite_css {#rewrite_css}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/rewrite_css/)

#### What it does

`rewrite_css` parses each stylesheet, minifies it, and rewrites the `url()` references inside it so images and fonts go through mod_pagespeed's optimization and cache-extension pipeline. The result is served from a rewritten `.pagespeed.cf.` URL with a long cache lifetime; the original file on disk is never touched. In OptimizeForBandwidth mode the minified bytes replace the original response in place and the URL stays as authored. Live demo: [rewrite_css](/examples/rewrite_css/).

```text
/* before */
/* Site header, see ticket 412 */
.header {
  margin: 0px 0px 16px 0px;
  background: #ffffff url(/img/banner.png) no-repeat;
}

/* after */
.header{margin:0 0 16px 0;background:#fff url(/img/banner.png.pagespeed.ce.HASH.png) no-repeat}
```

#### When it helps and when it does not

Minification helps most on hand-maintained CSS with comments and generous formatting, and the URL rewriting helps wherever stylesheet-referenced images are not already optimized. A build pipeline that already minifies and fingerprints its CSS leaves the filter little to do; running it anyway only adds a rewrite step. Because the parser declines a stylesheet it cannot fully parse rather than guessing, heavily hack-laden legacy CSS may pass through unminified — the companion `fallback_rewrite_css_urls` still rewrites the URLs inside such files.

#### How it decides

The filter runs a real CSS parser over the file. On a parse failure it produces no minified output and leaves minification to no one: only URL rewriting can still happen, through `fallback_rewrite_css_urls`. Values are shortened only where the equivalence is exact, such as `0px` to `0` and `#ffffff` to `#fff`. The stylesheet must sit on a domain the module is authorized to fetch, and the rewritten URL embeds a content hash so a changed file is picked up without a purge.

#### Risks

- A stylesheet that relies on parser-error recovery (old browser hacks) can be declined or rewritten differently than a browser would interpret it; test such files before rolling out.
- Verify with the `X-Mod-Pagespeed` response header and a `?PageSpeedFilters=-rewrite_css` comparison; [Is it working?](/docs/is-it-working/) has the steps.

#### Configuration

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters rewrite_css
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters rewrite_css;
```

### fallback_rewrite_css_urls {#fallback_rewrite_css_urls}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/fallback_rewrite_css_urls/)

Core filter. Rewrites resource URLs embedded in CSS files even when CSS parsing fails. Acts as a safety net for non-standard CSS that the full parser cannot handle.

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters fallback_rewrite_css_urls
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters fallback_rewrite_css_urls;
```

### rewrite_style_attributes / rewrite_style_attributes_with_url {#rewrite_style_attributes}

<a id="rewrite_style_attributes_with_url"></a>

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/rewrite_style_attributes/) · Also: [`rewrite_style_attributes_with_url`](/docs/filters/rewrite_style_attributes_with_url/)

`rewrite_style_attributes` applies CSS rewriting (minification, URL rewriting) to inline `style=""` attributes on HTML elements. `rewrite_style_attributes_with_url` (Core filter) does the same but only when the style value contains a `url()` reference.

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters rewrite_style_attributes
# or, for URL-only (enabled by default as a CoreFilter):
ModPagespeedEnableFilters rewrite_style_attributes_with_url
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters rewrite_style_attributes;
# or, for URL-only (enabled by default as a CoreFilter):
pagespeed EnableFilters rewrite_style_attributes_with_url;
```

### combine_css {#combine_css}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/combine_css/)

#### What it does

`combine_css` concatenates consecutive `<link rel="stylesheet">` references into one stylesheet and swaps the group for a single `<link>` to the combined file at a `.pagespeed.cc.` URL. Three stylesheets in a row become one request, and the rules keep their original order so the cascade is unchanged. Live demo: [combine_css](/examples/combine_css/).

```html
<!-- before -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/reset.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/layout.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/theme.css" />

<!-- after -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/reset.css+layout.css+theme.css.pagespeed.cc.HASH.css" />
```

#### When it helps and when it does not

Combining was designed for HTTP/1.1 connection limits. CSS is render-blocking, so even over HTTP/2 one combined fetch can beat several discovered-in-parallel fetches, but the margin is much smaller than it was: multiplexing removes the queueing that made combining essential. The counter-costs are real: the combined file invalidates as a whole when any member changes, and first paint waits for the entire combined download. Sites that already ship one bundled stylesheet gain nothing.

#### How it decides

Only consecutive links with the same `media` value combine; a different `media` attribute starts a new group, as does an inline `<style>` block, an IE conditional comment, a `<link>` inside `<noscript>`, or a link carrying extra attributes such as `id` or `title`, which is left as authored. Every member must come from a domain the module is authorized to fetch. `MaxCombinedCssBytes` caps the combined size and defaults to -1, no limit.

#### Risks

- Relative `url()` paths inside combined files are resolved against each member's own location, so members from different directories combine safely; what does not survive is markup that depends on the exact set of `<link>` elements, such as scripts that toggle stylesheets by index.
- Verify with the `X-Mod-Pagespeed` response header and a `?PageSpeedFilters=-combine_css` comparison; [Is it working?](/docs/is-it-working/) has the steps.

#### Configuration

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters combine_css
ModPagespeedMaxCombinedCssBytes 102400
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters combine_css;
pagespeed MaxCombinedCssBytes 102400;
```

### flatten_css_imports {#flatten_css_imports}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/flatten_css_imports/)

Core filter. Replaces CSS `@import` rules with the contents of the imported file. Eliminates round trips caused by import chains. The `CssFlattenMaxBytes` parameter (default: 1024000) limits the size of the resulting flattened CSS. Flattening is trickier than plain concatenation — media queries, charset rules, and relative URLs all have to survive the merge; see [flattening CSS @imports](/blog/flatten-css-imports-edge-cases/) for the edge cases.

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters flatten_css_imports
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters flatten_css_imports;
```

### inline_css {#inline_css}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/inline_css/)

#### What it does

`inline_css` replaces a small external stylesheet with an inline `<style>` block holding the file's contents, so first paint no longer waits on that fetch. Relative `url()` paths inside the stylesheet are made absolute first, so images and fonts keep resolving from the page's location. Live demo: [inline_css](/examples/inline_css/).

```text
<!-- before: a render-blocking request for a 1.8 KB file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/header.css">

<!-- after: the rules sit inside the page -->
<style>.site-header{display:flex;gap:1rem}.site-header img{height:2rem}</style>
```

#### When it helps and when it does not

CSS is render-blocking, so for a tiny stylesheet the removed round trip is worth more than the bytes: the request, its headers, and its connection setup all cost more than a kilobyte of inline text. The trade flips as files grow or get shared. An inlined stylesheet is not cached on its own, so it downloads again with every page view, and a file inlined into twenty pages is transferred twenty times. Stylesheets shared across many pages, and anything well above the threshold, are better left external with a long cache lifetime. `inline_css` is a CoreFilter, so the trade is already live on a default install.

#### How it decides

Only stylesheets whose contents are no larger than `CssInlineMaxBytes` (default 2048 bytes) qualify, and only files on domains the module is authorized to fetch. A stylesheet whose `media` attribute cannot affect the screen, such as `print`, stays external: inlining it would make every page pay for rules no screen visitor needs. A file that contains the text `</style>` stays external too, since it would end the inline block early. Nothing is inlined when the page's Content-Security-Policy forbids inline styles.

#### Risks

- The page grows by the stylesheet's size on every view, so keep `CssInlineMaxBytes` small. Raising it to inline a large file delays the HTML itself, which is worse than the fetch it removes.
- Verify with the `X-Mod-Pagespeed` response header and a `?PageSpeedFilters=-inline_css` comparison; [Is it working?](/docs/is-it-working/) has the steps.

#### Configuration

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters inline_css
ModPagespeedCssInlineMaxBytes 2048
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters inline_css;
pagespeed CssInlineMaxBytes 2048;
```

### inline_import_to_link {#inline_import_to_link}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/inline_import_to_link/)

Core filter. Converts `<style>@import url(...);</style>` to `<link rel="stylesheet">`, enabling other CSS filters (combining, minification) to process the imported stylesheet.

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters inline_import_to_link
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters inline_import_to_link;
```

### inline_google_font_css {#inline_google_font_css}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/inline_google_font_css/)

Not a core filter. Fetches the CSS from the Google Fonts API and inlines it directly into the HTML, eliminating one round trip. Requires HTTPS fetching to be enabled. GDPR considerations apply in the EU: inlining the CSS avoids the browser contacting Google Fonts servers directly, which can help with compliance.

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters inline_google_font_css
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters inline_google_font_css;
```

### outline_css {#outline_css}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/outline_css/)

Experimental. The inverse of `inline_css`: externalizes large inline `<style>` blocks into separate CSS files that can be cached independently. Rarely useful in practice. The `CssOutlineMinBytes` parameter (default: 3000) sets the minimum inline CSS size to externalize.

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters outline_css
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters outline_css;
```

### prioritize_critical_css {#prioritize_critical_css}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/prioritize_critical_css/)

Not a core filter. Test before deploying. Inlines the CSS rules a page uses and loads each full stylesheet without blocking the first paint. The full stylesheet is preloaded from the place its `<link>` had in the page and takes effect there as soon as it has arrived, so the order in which your rules apply does not change; a `<noscript>` copy of the link covers visitors without scripts, and inline `<style>` blocks are left as they are. By default the inlined rules cover every element in the page as visitors' browsers last saw it, so content further down the page is styled from the first paint too. Uses a JavaScript beacon to collect critical CSS data from real user visits. The beacon endpoint must be accessible for data collection to work. Can cut perceived load time, but test it against your own page layouts first. In v1.15.0+r18 and later, the filter honors a restrictive `Content-Security-Policy` when `HonorCsp` is enabled: on pages whose policy disallows inline styles or scripts, it passes the page through unchanged instead of injecting content the policy would block. For the trade-offs behind critical-CSS extraction, see [how critical CSS is identified](/blog/critical-css-heuristics/).

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters prioritize_critical_css
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters prioritize_critical_css;
```

If you prefer a smaller inline block and accept that content below the first screen may be partly styled until the full stylesheet arrives, turn on `CriticalCssAboveTheFoldOnly` (off by default): `ModPagespeedCriticalCssAboveTheFoldOnly on` on Apache, `pagespeed CriticalCssAboveTheFoldOnly on;` on nginx, `pagespeed CriticalCssAboveTheFoldOnly on` on IIS.

**What to expect.** After you deploy a changed stylesheet, the filter leaves that page's stylesheets blocking for a few page views, until visitors' browsers have reported on the new rules. After a page's markup changes without its stylesheets changing, rules that newly apply can be late until a visitor's browser reports on the new markup; the module asks for a report again after about a minute by default (twelve times `BeaconReinstrumentTimeSec`), and the wait is longer when the visitor who is asked does not report. The browser reports which rules the page uses once the page has loaded, so content that a script removes, hides or gives other class names before then can be painted without the rules that applied only to its earlier state, until the full stylesheet arrives. Content a script adds while the page is loading takes its rules from the full stylesheet. The full stylesheet is turned on by a small inline script: if something in front of your server delays inline scripts, the full styles arrive when that script runs. For pages whose markup differs from visitor to visitor under one URL, leave the filter off (`DisableFilters prioritize_critical_css` for that location).

A stylesheet keeps its ordinary blocking `<link>` when it uses an `@import` the server cannot merge into it, when nearly all of it would be inline anyway, or when its `<link>` carries an event-handler attribute, a `title` or `disabled`. A page with more matching selectors than one report can carry keeps its blocking stylesheets until a complete report arrives (see the `beacon_overflow_count` statistic). The filter needs the beacon and therefore does nothing on Envoy.

### move_css_above_scripts {#move_css_above_scripts}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/move_css_above_scripts/)

Not a core filter. Moves `<link rel="stylesheet">` elements above `<script>` elements in the HTML to prevent CSS-blocking-JS render delays. Generally safe for most sites.

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters move_css_above_scripts
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters move_css_above_scripts;
```

### move_css_to_head {#move_css_to_head}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/move_css_to_head/)

Not a core filter. Moves `<link rel="stylesheet">` elements from the `<body>` into `<head>` for earlier browser discovery and faster rendering. Generally safe for most sites.

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters move_css_to_head
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters move_css_to_head;
```

### extend_cache_css {#extend_cache_css}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/extend_cache_css/)

Core filter, one of the three members of [`extend_cache`](/docs/cache-control/#extend_cache). Rewrites `<link rel="stylesheet">` URLs to content-hashed `.pagespeed.ce.` URLs that the module serves with a one-year `Cache-Control` max-age, so browsers keep stylesheets for a year and still pick up every change (a changed file gets a new URL). Use it when the origin cannot set long cache lifetimes itself; under CoreFilters it is already on through `extend_cache`. Disabling it leaves `extend_cache_images` and `extend_cache_scripts` on. The one rule to respect is the general one: HTML and the resources it references must share one configuration (see [Virtual hosts](/docs/configuration/#virtual-hosts)). Live demo: [extend_cache](/examples/extend_cache/).

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters extend_cache_css
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters extend_cache_css;
```

### compute_critical_css {#compute_critical_css}

[Full guide →](/docs/filters/compute_critical_css/)

Not a core filter; experimental. Computes a page's critical CSS on the server in the background, instead of from the browser reports that [`prioritize_critical_css`](#prioritize_critical_css) uses. It is the module's older, beacon-free path and is not tuned for production: use `prioritize_critical_css` unless you are specifically testing this one. Enabling it adds server-side CSS analysis for every page it sees. There is no example in the gallery.

Enable:

```apache
# Apache
ModPagespeedEnableFilters compute_critical_css
```

```nginx
# Nginx
pagespeed EnableFilters compute_critical_css;
```
