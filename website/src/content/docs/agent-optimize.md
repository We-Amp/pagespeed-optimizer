faq:
  - q: 'Does this change what browsers and search engines see?'
    a: 'No. Browsers and crawlers receive your normal HTML at the same URL. Only a request that explicitly negotiates the agent representation (Accept: text/markdown), on a deployment where you have enabled agent optimization, receives the rendered-Markdown copy. The response carries Vary: Accept so shared caches never mix the two.'
  - q: 'Is it on by default?'
    a: 'No. The capability ships in every build but stays off until you enable it with the --agent-optimize worker flag. There is no separate build.'
  - q: 'Does my content leave my server?'
    a: 'No. Rendering, cleaning, caching, and serving all happen on your own server. Serving a cached response performs zero outbound network I/O.'
  - q: 'Does this work with the module alone, or does it need the optimizer worker?'
    a: 'Yes. The rendered-Markdown variant runs in the optimizer worker behind nginx, using headless Chrome. The module recognizes and safely declines the agent request (it always serves normal HTML); it does not produce the rendered variant.'
  - q: 'What is the synthesized /llms.txt, and is it your /llms.txt?'
    a: 'The optimizer worker can publish a synthesized /llms.txt for YOUR site — a Markdown index built from your own sitemap, off by default and enabled by its own worker flag. It is unrelated to the /llms.txt on modpagespeed.com, which describes our product. The index is built off the serving path and serving it performs zero outbound network I/O. It needs the worker: the module alone does not produce it.'

AI agents and LLM crawlers fetch your pages to read, summarize, and act on them —
but a JavaScript-rendered site often
[looks empty to a client that does not execute scripts](/blog/can-ai-read-your-website/).
The mod_pagespeed 2.1 optimizer worker can serve those agents a **rendered,
readable copy** of each page, at the **same URL**, without changing anything a
browser or search engine sees.

:::caution[Experimental]
Agent optimization — the rendered-Markdown variant and the synthesized
`/llms.txt` — ships off by default. Its flags and behavior may change in a
future release, so evaluate it in staging before enabling it in production.
:::

## How it works

When an agent requests a page with `Accept: text/markdown` and you have enabled
agent optimization, the optimizer worker serves a Markdown
representation produced from the **fully-rendered DOM** — JavaScript executed,
layout settled. JS-heavy pages that are otherwise invisible to agents become
clean, structured text. Everyone else gets your normal optimized HTML at that
same URL.

The agent response is content-negotiated, with these guarantees:

- `Vary: Accept` — shared caches never serve the Markdown copy to a browser, or
  the HTML to an agent.
- `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` and `Cache-Control: private` — the agent copy stays
  out of search indexes and shared caches.
- The page **body and Content-Type for browsers are unchanged** — standard
  content negotiation on `Accept`, not cloaking.

The rendering runs in the optimizer worker process behind nginx, reusing
the same headless-Chrome subsystem as [browser analysis](/docs/browser-analysis/).

## Off by default

The capability is present in every build, but it does nothing until you enable
agent optimization on the worker (`--agent-optimize`, or
`PAGESPEED_AGENT_OPTIMIZE=true` in the Docker images). It also requires browser
analysis (`--enable-browser-analysis`), since the Markdown copy is produced from
the rendered DOM.

While the flag is off, an agent request **transparently receives the normal
HTML** of the same URL — never an error, never a half-rendered page. Turning the
feature off is always safe.

## Serve an `/llms.txt` site index

The optimizer worker can also publish a synthesized **`/llms.txt`** for your
site — a compact Markdown index that points AI agents at your important pages,
in the [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) format. The worker builds it from your own
`sitemap.xml` (intersected with the paths you allow), with a one-line title and
summary per page, and nginx serves it at `/llms.txt` with `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`,
`Cache-Control: private`, and `Content-Type: text/markdown`.

It is off by default and enabled with its own flag (`--agent-optimize-llms-txt`,
which requires `--agent-optimize`). Per-page summaries come for free: from a page's
already-rendered agent copy when one exists, or from a cheap title/description
read otherwise. The file is **never** built by rendering pages on demand. The
index is generated and cached off the serving path and refreshed lazily when your
sitemap changes (or once a day at most).

Content is left out if your `robots.txt` tells AI crawlers to stay away, or if a
page opts out with `noai` / `X-Robots-Tag: noai`. A site that blocks AI crawlers
entirely gets no `/llms.txt` at all.

:::note[Not the same file as ours]
The `/llms.txt` on modpagespeed.com describes the *product*; this feature
publishes an `/llms.txt` for *your* site, from *your* content. They are
unrelated.
:::

Like the rendered-Markdown copy, `/llms.txt` needs the optimizer worker and its
headless-Chrome substrate; the module alone does not produce it.

## Nothing leaves your server

Rendering, cleaning, caching, and serving all happen on your own server. Serving a cached response — a page, the agent Markdown copy, or
`/llms.txt` — makes **no third-party network call**: no DNS, no telemetry, no
analytics, no beacon.

The only network activity happens off the serving path:

- Building the `/llms.txt` index fetches your own `sitemap.xml` and pages.
- Rendering may fetch a page's *own* resources.
- Both go through the same SSRF-guarded fetcher, IP-pinned to your origin.

This makes agent optimization suitable for sovereign and regulated environments
where content must not leave the premises.

## Enabling it

Start the worker with `--agent-optimize` (and `--enable-browser-analysis`), then
add `--agent-optimize-llms-txt` if you also want the synthesized `/llms.txt`.
Evaluate it in staging first: the capability is experimental and its flags may
change.
