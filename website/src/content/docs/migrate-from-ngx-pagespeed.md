faq:
  - q: 'Do my pagespeed directives carry over from ngx_pagespeed?'
    a: 'Yes. The native nginx module keeps the `pagespeed` directive surface and the classic filter names. Every directive loads; a handful of long-inert filters and experimental options are accepted and ignored with a warning, and four directives are new.'
  - q: 'Why does nginx refuse to load the new module?'
    a: 'Each module build is pinned to the exact nginx version your distribution ships. An nginx from another repository, including the one a third-party ngx_pagespeed package was built against, has a different version string and nginx refuses the module. Run the stock nginx, or contact us for a matching build.'

mod_pagespeed 2.1 continues the nginx port. If you run the open-source
`ngx_pagespeed` today, whether you compiled it into nginx yourself or
installed a third-party package build of it such as the GetPageSpeed packages,
the move is a package swap: remove the old module, install the signed
`nginx-module-pagespeed`, keep your `pagespeed` directives. One `load_module`
line and a restart later, the same configuration runs on a module built
against current nginx and kept security-patched.

## Before you start

Record what you run, and keep a copy of the old module to roll back to:

```bash
nginx -V 2>&1 | grep -o 'ngx_pagespeed[^ ]*'                   # compiled in, or
ls /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_pagespeed*.so                     # a dynamic module
curl -I http://localhost/ | grep X-Page-Speed                   # the version in service
sudo cp /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_pagespeed_module.so{,.bak}   # if dynamic
```

**Mind the nginx version.** Each `nginx-module-pagespeed` build is pinned to
the exact nginx version your distribution ships (see the
[compatibility table](/docs/installation-module/#nginx-compatibility)), and
nginx refuses to load a module built for another version. A third-party
ngx_pagespeed package usually targets, or comes with, an nginx from that same
third-party repository rather than the distribution's. Before you install,
decide whether to move nginx back to the distribution package too; otherwise
[contact us](/contact/) for a matching pinned build.

## Steps

1. **Remove the old module and its repository.** Uninstall the third-party
   package, and disable the repository it came from so the package manager
   cannot pick the old build again; for a compiled-in module, plan to replace
   the nginx binary with the distribution's. Leave your `pagespeed` directives
   in place.
2. **Install the signed module:**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://packages.modpagespeed.com/install.sh | sudo sh
   sudo apt-get install nginx-module-pagespeed    # Debian / Ubuntu
   sudo dnf install nginx-module-pagespeed        # AlmaLinux / RHEL / Rocky
   ```

3. **Point `load_module` at the new file.** Exactly one `load_module` line for
   pagespeed, naming `/usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_pagespeed_module.so`, the
   file the package installs; remove any line that named the old build.
4. **Test and restart:** `sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx`.
5. **Verify:** `curl -I http://localhost/ | grep X-Page-Speed`. The header
   carries the new module version. [Is it working?](/docs/is-it-working/) has
   the other checks.

To add the optimizer worker, install `pagespeed-optimizer` from the same
repository and set two directives; see
[Using the optimizer worker with nginx](/docs/installation-module/#using-the-optimizer-daemon-with-nginx).

No directive was renamed. The `.pagespeed.` resource URLs, the `X-Page-Speed`
header and the beacon paths are unchanged, so existing CDN rules keep working.

## The cache

The module keeps its cache in a Cyclone volume under `FileCachePath`. The
per-resource files an older ngx_pagespeed left in that directory are ignored,
not deleted, and resources are re-optimized on first request, so expect a
brief warm-up. Cache contents persist across restarts, so the warm-up is a
one-time cost. Remove the old per-resource files once the new module has run
for a while; leave the Cyclone volume beside them alone.

## Roll back

Restore the old module file, or the old nginx package, and restart nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo cp /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_pagespeed_module.so.bak /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_pagespeed_module.so
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

A third-party package rolls back by reinstalling it from its own repository;
remove `nginx-module-pagespeed` first so the two do not both claim the module
path.
