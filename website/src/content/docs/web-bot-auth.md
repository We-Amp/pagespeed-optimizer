title: 'Verify AI crawlers with Web Bot Auth'
description: 'Check RFC 9421 signatures from AI crawlers at your origin and label each request with a verified bot identity — observe-only, off by default.'

group: 'Operate'
lastUpdated: 2026-07-04
faq:
  - q: 'Does it ever block a request?'
    a: 'No. The verifier is observe-only: it labels signature-bearing requests with an x-verified-bot response header and counts verdicts in /v1/metrics. It never changes how a request is served — no blocking, no cache variation, no redirect.'
  - q: 'Is it on by default?'
    a: 'No. The verifier ships in every 2.0.34+ build but stays off until you enable it with PAGESPEED_WEB_BOT_AUTH=true and configure at least one key directory. When off, requests are handled exactly as before.'
  - q: 'Does verifying signatures slow requests down?'
    a: 'No measurable cost. Requests without signature headers short-circuit before any work. Signature-bearing requests get at most one Ed25519 verification against keys already warmed in memory — verification never fetches anything over the network on the request path.'
  - q: 'Which bots can it verify?'
    a: 'Any client that signs requests with RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures under the Web Bot Auth convention (tag="web-bot-auth", Ed25519) and publishes its public keys in an HTTPS JWKS key directory you configure. That covers Web Bot Auth adopters among AI crawlers and any signer you run yourself.'
  - q: 'Is this available in mod_pagespeed 1.15?'
    a: 'Yes. mod_pagespeed 1.15 ships the same verifier core for nginx, configured with pagespeed directives and exposing the verdict as the $x_verified_bot nginx variable. ModPageSpeed 2.0 configures it via environment variables and emits the verdict as a response header.'
  - q: 'What does "invalid" include?'
    a: 'Everything that carried signature material but fail-closed: tampered or expired Web Bot Auth signatures, signatures referencing keys you have not configured, and unparseable signature headers from other ecosystems (for example bare draft-cavage Signature headers used by some webhook and fediverse deliveries). Parseable RFC 9421 material that is simply not Web Bot Auth is counted separately as "other" and treated as unsigned.'

Any client can claim to be any crawler — a `User-Agent` string is unverified
text. [Web Bot Auth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/webbotauth/about/) fixes
that with cryptography: a bot signs its requests with an Ed25519 key
([RFC 9421](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html) HTTP Message
Signatures) and publishes the public half in a JWKS key directory at a
well-known HTTPS URL. ModPageSpeed 2.0 can verify those signatures at your
origin and tell you, per request, **which bot actually sent it**.

:::caution[Experimental]
The Web Bot Auth verifier is an **experimental** feature. It ships in 2.0.34+,
off by default and **observe-only**: it labels and counts, and never changes
how a request is served. Its configuration surface and behavior may change
between releases, and there is no general-availability commitment for this
feature yet.
:::

## What you get

For every request that carries Web Bot Auth signature material, the response
gains an `x-verified-bot` header:

| Request | `x-verified-bot` |
|---|---|
| Valid signature, key id in your verified-bots map | `<bot-name>, ed25519-verified` |
| Valid signature, key id not in the map | `signed-agent` |
| Tampered/expired signature, or an unknown key | `unknown` |
| No signature material (browsers, ordinary crawlers) | *no header* |

Requests without signature headers are untouched — the label never inflates
ordinary traffic. Aggregate counts are exported at `/v1/metrics`:

```text
pagespeed_webbotauth_signed_requests_total{result="verified"}
pagespeed_webbotauth_signed_requests_total{result="invalid"}
pagespeed_webbotauth_signed_requests_total{result="other"}
```

`verified` covers both mapped and unmapped valid signatures; `invalid` is
signature material that fail-closed; `other` is parseable RFC 9421 material
that is not Web Bot Auth (for example a CDN signing scheme), which is treated
as unsigned.

## Enabling it

Three environment variables on the worker container (Docker and Helm deploys
alike). Changing them requires a worker restart.

```yaml
services:
  worker:
    image: ghcr.io/we-amp/pagespeed-worker:2.1.0
    environment:
      - PAGESPEED_WEB_BOT_AUTH=true
      # Comma-separated HTTPS JWKS key-directory URLs (no spaces).
      - PAGESPEED_WEB_BOT_AUTH_KEY_DIRECTORIES=https://example-bot.com/.well-known/http-message-signatures-directory
      # Optional: promote key ids to readable bot names ("keyid=name,...").
      - PAGESPEED_WEB_BOT_AUTH_VERIFIED_BOTS=NFcWBUXB-example-key-id=examplebot
```

The matching worker command-line flags are `--web-bot-auth`,
`--web-bot-auth-key-directory <url>` (repeatable) and
`--web-bot-auth-verified-bots "keyid=name,..."`.

- **Key directories** must be HTTPS; the worker rejects plain-HTTP URLs at
  startup. The worker fetches and refreshes each directory periodically in the
  background, so key rotations by the bot operator are picked up without a
  restart — and verification itself never waits on the network.
- **The verified-bots map** is your allowlist of identities worth naming. A
  key id you have mapped renders as `<name>, ed25519-verified`; a valid
  signature from an unmapped key still verifies, but renders as the generic
  `signed-agent`.

## Reading the results

Spot-check the header from your logs or by inspecting responses to a signed
crawler you operate. For trend lines, scrape `/v1/metrics` (see the
[HTTP API](/docs/http-api/) for authentication) — the three counters make it
easy to answer "how much of my AI-crawler traffic is actually verifiable?"

Unsigned bot traffic — the majority today — simply shows no header and no
counter increment. The interesting signal is the split between `verified`
(cryptographically attributable crawls) and `invalid` (something sent
signature material that did not check out).

## Opt-in verified-crawl counter

:::caution[Experimental]
The opt-in counter is an **experimental** apparatus built alongside the
verifier. It is **off by default** and has **no general-availability
commitment**. Its shape and behavior may change between releases.
:::

Separately from the first-party `/v1/metrics` counters above, you can *opt in*
to publishing a small, machine-readable summary of your verified AI-crawl
volume at a well-known endpoint. It is off unless you enable it, and it never
changes how requests are served.

Enabling any non-`off` mode **publishes a discoverable marker** at:

```text
/.well-known/webbotauth-counter
```

Two configuration knobs — one non-secret mode, one secret token:

```yaml
services:
  worker:
    environment:
      # off (default) | private | public
      - PAGESPEED_WEB_BOT_AUTH_PUBLIC_COUNTER=public
  # The bearer token gating the exact document is read by the front-end from
  # its own environment (kept out of any shared, world-readable config):
  frontend:
    environment:
      - PAGESPEED_WEB_BOT_AUTH_COUNTER_TOKEN=<a long random secret>
```

The matching worker flag is `--web-bot-auth-public-counter <off|private|public>`.

Behavior by mode:

| Mode | No / invalid token | Valid bearer token |
|---|---|---|
| `off` (default) | endpoint returns `404` (invisible) | `404` |
| `private` | `404` (existence hidden) | **exact** document |
| `public` | **coarse** document (bucketed) | **exact** document |

- The **exact** document reports the counting-start date, an instance
  identifier (`boot_id`), cumulative verified / invalid / other totals, and a
  per-signer breakdown (signer name where you have mapped the key id, otherwise
  a reproducible key-id hash — see below). It is served `Cache-Control:
  no-store`.
- The **coarse** document is deliberately narrower to reduce fingerprinting: it
  replaces every count with a fixed size tier (for example `1k-10k`), omits the
  counting-start date and the instance identifier, and lists **only your
  registered signers** as `name` → tier (unregistered/hash-only signers and the
  exact distinct-signer count are not disclosed). It is public and cacheable
  (`max-age=300`, `Vary: Authorization`).
- Present the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Only `GET` and `HEAD`
  are served; the document reflects no request data, carries no version or
  build identifiers, and is served with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

Verify latency is **not** included in either document — it stays a first-party
signal on `/v1/metrics` only.

### About the identifiers

- **`boot_id`** is an *instance* identifier, not a per-restart value. It is
  minted once when the counting file is first created and stays the same across
  ordinary worker restarts (which reset the counters but keep the file); it
  changes only when the file is recreated. So distinct `boot_id`s across
  responses indicate distinct instances (for example behind a load balancer),
  and a counter **reset** is detectable as a *decrease* in a cumulative total —
  not as a change in `boot_id`.
- **The key-id hash** (used for a verified signer that is not in your
  verified-bots map) is a plain, unsalted
  [FNV-1a-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function)
  of the raw key-id bytes — 64-bit offset basis `0xcbf29ce484222325`, prime
  `0x100000001b3`, rendered as 16 lowercase hex digits and prefixed `hash:`. The
  single input that would hash to `0` is remapped to a fixed non-zero value (`0`
  is the empty-slot marker). It is intentionally reproducible: anyone can hash a
  known key id and match it against the document, which is what lets a signer
  recognise its own crawls at an origin that has not named its key.

This page covers the ModPageSpeed 2.0 configuration. For the concept in depth
and the equivalent mod_pagespeed 1.15 nginx directives, see
[Verify AI crawlers with Web Bot Auth](/blog/verify-ai-crawlers-web-bot-auth/).

The verifier described here is observe-only — it labels and counts, and never
blocks. If you need to gate a surface on a signed capability token, see the
experimental [RSL-CAP token validation](/docs/rsl-cap/) layer, which validates
`Authorization: License` tokens and returns `401`/`402`/pass. It uses a separate,
isolated key trust domain from this verifier.
