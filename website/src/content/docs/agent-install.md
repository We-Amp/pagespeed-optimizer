A coding agent can install mod_pagespeed 2.1 from a recipe: one Markdown file
per server, written for an agent to run. Each recipe has the same five
sections: prerequisites check, install, minimal configuration, verification and
rollback. The commands are fenced, the values to fill in are placeholders in
angle brackets, and there is no prose beyond what a command needs.

The recipes derive from these docs. Every command in a recipe comes from the
docs pages it names at the top; when a command changes, the docs change first
and the recipe follows.

## The recipes

## How an agent uses a recipe

1. **Prerequisites.** Pick the recipe for the server that serves the site's
   HTML and run its checks. Stop at the first failure and report it.
2. **Install.** Run the install commands as written. Privileged commands
   (`sudo`, an elevated PowerShell, `msiexec`, `docker`, `helm`) need the
   operator's go-ahead, and so does any install on a server that takes
   production traffic.
3. **Configure.** Apply the minimal configuration, replacing each
   `<placeholder>` with a value from the project.
4. **Verify.** Request the site's own page and check one response header:
   `X-Page-Speed` (nginx, IIS), `X-Mod-Pagespeed` (Apache) or `X-PageSpeed`
   (ASP.NET Core, Docker, Helm). The install is complete only when that header
   is present.
5. **Roll back.** If verification fails after one pass through the
   troubleshooting link, the rollback section is written to undo only what the
   run created and to leave anything that existed before in place.

## The verification marker

The verification request carries a fixed query string, `?mps-verify=agent`.
mod_pagespeed ignores the parameter. The request goes only to the server being
verified, so the marker lands only in that server's own access log, where the
operator can count agent-run verifications:

```bash
grep -c 'mps-verify=agent' /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

Nothing in a recipe reports anywhere. The recipes themselves call only the
documented install channels: the package repository, GHCR, the Helm repository,
nuget.org and the download page. apt, dnf, Docker and Helm then pull
dependencies from the sources they are configured with.

## The install skill

The `install-modpagespeed` skill wraps the recipes for agents that load skills:
it detects the server, fetches the matching recipe, runs it and runs the
verification. Its source is in the
[pagespeed-optimizer repository](https://github.com/We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer/tree/main/.claude/skills/install-modpagespeed).

In Claude Code, add the repository as a plugin marketplace and install the
plugin:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer
claude plugin install modpagespeed@modpagespeed
```

Claude Code can then pick the skill when you ask for a mod_pagespeed install,
or you can run it directly as `/modpagespeed:install-modpagespeed`.

For other agents that read skill directories, the `skills` command-line tool
copies the skill into the current project:

```bash
npx skills add We-Amp/pagespeed-optimizer --skill install-modpagespeed
```

An agent without skill support can be given a recipe URL directly, for example
"install mod_pagespeed by following https://modpagespeed.com/recipes/nginx.md".
