    - name: Confirm the fix took
      text: Compare web-vitals onINP attribution logs before and after deploy and re-record the DevTools Performance flow to confirm the worst interaction is under 200 ms on Razor/MVC. Re-run PageSpeed Insights and check the field INP, then review the Search Console Core Web Vitals report after 28 days. For Blazor Server, re-check the SignalR frame round-trip, which is the floor the app can approach but not go below.

ASP.NET Core has two different INP profiles depending on the frontend. Razor Pages / MVC with vanilla JS or jQuery has a fixable INP problem — the [**WeAmp.PageSpeed ASP.NET Core middleware**](/blog/aspnet-core-middleware/) runs the same in-process optimization pipeline, which minifies JavaScript and defers the scripts its browser analysis proves safe — so startup script work stops competing for the main thread. Blazor Server has an INP problem that is **architectural and unfixable without changing the rendering model**: every interaction is a SignalR round-trip, which means INP is bounded below by network latency plus server render time. Both cases covered below.

## What INP measures

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is the worst-case latency between a user input — click, tap, keypress — and the next frame the browser paints in response. Chrome watches every interaction across the page's lifetime and reports the 98th-percentile slowest one as that page's INP. Good is **≤ 200 ms**, "needs improvement" runs to 500 ms, and past 500 ms is failing. Real-user numbers come from CrUX; the lab approximation in PSI is unreliable here because Lighthouse drives no human input — so on ASP.NET Core, where Blazor's interaction model never even runs in the lab, the field number is the only one that matters. See [web.dev/inp](https://web.dev/articles/inp).

## The most common INP failures on ASP.NET Core

The failures split cleanly along the rendering-model line. Pick the section that matches your stack.

**Razor Pages / MVC with vanilla JS or jQuery:**

1. **`bundle.min.js` loaded synchronously in `<head>`.** Visual Studio's default templates still put `<script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>` (and `bootstrap.bundle.min.js`, and `jquery-validation`) in `<head>` ahead of the LCP element. Even with `defer`, the parse + init still has to complete before the first interaction can be handled — typically 100–250 ms of cost on a mid-range Android.
2. **Anti-forgery token validation on POST inflates handler latency.** Razor Pages auto-validate the anti-forgery token on every POST handler. If the handler also does a DB call, the synchronous validate-then-handle path means form-submit INP includes network + token-validate + handler. 300 ms+ is common.
3. **jQuery validation runs synchronously on every keystroke.** `jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js` attaches `keyup` and `blur` validators that re-run on every input event. On a form with 8+ fields, the per-keystroke handler can hit 30–60 ms, recorded as INP on the worst keystroke.

**Blazor Server:**

1. **Every interaction is a SignalR round-trip.** Blazor Server renders on the server and pushes DOM diffs over SignalR. INP on a button click = network latency + server render time + diff apply. For a transatlantic user (~150 ms RTT), the floor before any work is done is already at the "Needs improvement" boundary.
2. **Disconnected-then-reconnect spikes INP.** SignalR reconnect on a flaky network causes the next interaction's INP to balloon to seconds. Reconnect handling is by design but is INP-visible.
3. **Component re-render on parent state change cascades to children.** A `StateHasChanged()` call near the top of the component tree triggers re-render of everything below; the diff sent over SignalR can be megabytes. INP on the click that triggered it is the wait for the full diff to apply.

## Identify the worst interaction

Identifying _which interaction_ records the bad INP is more important on ASP.NET Core than elsewhere because the answer dictates whether MPS is even the right tool.

- Open the page in Chrome, DevTools → **Performance** panel, record, perform a realistic user flow (nav click, form fill, submit). Stop. The **Interactions** track names the worst interaction; clicking it shows the flame chart.
- Install [`web-vitals`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) with `attribution` in `_Layout.cshtml`. Log `onINP(console.log, {reportAllChanges: true})` from a small `<script type="module">` block. The `attribution.eventEntry` field names the responsible handler.
- Run PSI: `https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis?url=<URL>`. Lab INP numbers are unreliable; the field-data section under "Discover what your real users are experiencing" is the one to read.
- For Blazor Server specifically: open DevTools → **Network** → filter for "WebSocket". Each interaction shows as a frame on the SignalR connection. The time from frame-send to frame-receive is the network floor on your INP.

Output: a specific interaction, the script (or `_blazor` SignalR frame), and whether the cost is parse, handler logic, or network round-trip.

## Reduce parse and transfer cost on Razor Pages / MVC

Blazor Server is out of scope for this step; skip to the framework-level tuning below.

**For Razor Pages / MVC sites**, the [WeAmp.PageSpeed ASP.NET Core middleware](/blog/aspnet-core-middleware/) (NuGet) runs the same in-process optimization pipeline as the nginx interceptor. Two behaviors lower INP, both on by default:

- **[JavaScript minification](/blog/safe-javascript-minification-semicolon-insertion/)** — always-on worker behavior; it strips inline and external JS down. The `.min.js` files are already minified, but inline `<script>` blocks in Razor partials usually are not. There is no toggle to switch it on.
- **Script deferral** (`options.Html.EnableScriptDeferral`, default on) — defers the scripts the worker's browser analysis proves safe, so jQuery + jQuery Validation parse no longer collides with the first click. Because it changes execution order — code in `<script>` blocks that depends on `$(document).ready` running before other scripts may break — stage and profile it before relying on it in production.

Wire it up in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
using WeAmp.PageSpeed.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddPageSpeed(options =>
{
    options.Cache.VolumePath = "/data/cache.vol";
    options.Cache.VolumeSizeBytes = 256 * 1024 * 1024;

    // JS minification is always-on worker behavior — no toggle.
    // Script deferral defaults to on; shown here for clarity.
    options.Html.EnableScriptDeferral = true;
});

var app = builder.Build();
app.UsePageSpeed();
```

**For Blazor Server**, mod_pagespeed 2.1 cannot help. SignalR round-trips are the dominant INP cost; no rewriter operating on the response stream can shorten a network round-trip. Skip this step entirely and go straight to the framework-level tuning below.

## Where the framework still helps

**For Razor Pages / MVC:**

- Replace jQuery validation with native HTML5 form validation (`required`, `type="email"`, `pattern=`) + a 1 KB error-display helper. Drops a 30+ KB JS dependency and removes per-keystroke validator handlers — the same [remove-unused-JavaScript](/blog/remove-unused-javascript-chrome-coverage/) logic that lowers parse cost at the source.
- Bundle and minify with [WebOptimizer](https://github.com/ligershark/WebOptimizer) (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebOptimizer.Core` package). It outputs hashed, gzipped assets at build time.
- Use `<script type="module">` for ESM-style code paths. Modern browsers parse modules in a separate scheduler with lower INP impact than classic-script parse.
- Cache anti-forgery tokens client-side per session — reuse across forms instead of re-validating each.
- Move scripts to end-of-body via `@RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)` in `_Layout.cshtml`, not `<head>`.

**For Blazor Server:**

- **Switch to Blazor WebAssembly**, or use `@rendermode InteractiveAuto` (.NET 8+) to fall back to WASM after the second visit. WASM runs in-browser, so INP is bounded by client-side compute instead of network round-trip.
- If you must stay on Blazor Server: keep the user geographically close to the server. A US-region server with EU users has a 100+ ms RTT floor that no application change can remove.
- Avoid `StateHasChanged()` near the component-tree root. Push state down so the re-render fan-out is small.
- Use `ShouldRender()` overrides to skip diff computation on components whose state has not changed.
- Pre-render to static HTML for non-interactive routes (`@rendermode StaticSSR`) — INP is irrelevant there because there is no interaction.

## How to confirm it took

1. Compare `web-vitals` `onINP` attribution logs (from the Diagnose step) before and after deploy. The worst handler should be different — and shorter — than the baseline; for Razor/MVC sites the slowest entry should now sit in the "Good" band.
2. DevTools → Performance, re-record the user flow, confirm the **Interactions** track shows under-200 ms for the worst interaction.
3. For Blazor Server: re-check the SignalR frame round-trip time in DevTools → Network → WebSocket. That number is your floor; the application can be optimized down to it but not below.
4. Re-run PSI on the same URL. Field INP under "Interaction to Next Paint" should drop into the "Good" band for Razor/MVC sites after the rewriter + platform tuning. Blazor Server sites usually cannot exit "Needs improvement" without a re-architecture.
5. Wait 28 days, check Search Console → Core Web Vitals report. ASP.NET Core sites typically have a single URL group; track it as a whole.

## The middleware config

```csharp
// Program.cs — minimal config to address INP on ASP.NET Core (Razor/MVC)
using WeAmp.PageSpeed.AspNetCore;

builder.Services.AddPageSpeed(options =>
{
    options.Cache.VolumePath = "/data/cache.vol";
    options.Cache.VolumeSizeBytes = 256 * 1024 * 1024;

    // JS minification is always-on worker behavior — no toggle.
    // Script deferral defaults to on; shown here for clarity.
    options.Html.EnableScriptDeferral = true;
});

// In the pipeline, before MVC:
app.UsePageSpeed();
```

For sites still fronted by nginx (e.g., Kestrel behind nginx reverse proxy), the [nginx config from the WordPress post](/blog/fix-inp-wordpress-2026/) works unchanged.

**For Blazor Server: there is no MPS config that fixes INP. See "Where this approach falls short" below.**

## Where this approach falls short

The Blazor Server section, expanded because it dominates the failure modes here.

- **Blazor Server INP is architectural, not an optimization problem.** SignalR round-trips are by design; the framework was built for interactive line-of-business apps on a LAN, not public sites served to users on mobile. If you are seeing INP > 500 ms on a public Blazor Server site, mod_pagespeed and every other server-layer tool will fail to move the number meaningfully. The fix is Blazor WebAssembly, `@rendermode InteractiveAuto`, or a different frontend. We will not pretend otherwise.
- **Razor Pages with third-party JS controls.** Telerik, Syncfusion, and DevExpress UI controls ship their own JS frameworks. INP on a Telerik grid sort or DevExpress combo open is bounded by their library's render path — MPS minifies their bytes but cannot change their internal architecture.
- **TTFB-driven INP on uncached XHR endpoints.** If your interactive widgets fire `fetch('/api/something')` and your API endpoint takes 300 ms to respond, INP on that interaction is at least 300 ms. The fix is server-side — caching, async/await discipline in handlers, or DB indexing. Not page optimization.
- **SignalR reconnect spikes.** Even on Blazor WebAssembly, if you use SignalR for real-time updates and the connection drops, the next interaction may record a multi-second INP. Implement client-side queuing.
- **`StateHasChanged()` on hot paths.** A Blazor component that re-renders on every prop change cascades through its children. Profile with Blazor's built-in diagnostic counters before assuming MPS is the answer.

ASP.NET Core's INP story is almost entirely about what frontend you ship. mod_pagespeed handles the Razor / jQuery case cleanly; the Blazor Server case is one we route to the framework, not to ourselves.

mod_pagespeed 2.1 runs as ASP.NET Core middleware (NuGet) or as a module for Apache, nginx and IIS. The IIS package ships from the 1.15 packaging channel. On ASP.NET Core, install the middleware and run your app — it optimizes out of the box. See [pricing](/pricing/) and [license terms](/license/).
