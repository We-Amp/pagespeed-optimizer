It is one of the three Core Web Vitals, and Google scores it on <strong>field</strong> data: the 75th percentile of real Chrome users over the trailing 28 days, from the CrUX dataset. A page is good under 2.5 s and poor over 4 s.</p><p>There is no single fix for LCP, because it is not one number &mdash; it is four. PageSpeed Insights splits the LCP element into time to first byte, resource load delay, resource load duration, and element render delay. Each phase has different causes and different owners: some live in your backend, some in how the markup is delivered, some in your own application code. This page walks the four phases, then maps fixes to them, including the cases a server-layer optimizer cannot touch.

The two routinely disagree, because real visitors run slower hardware on slower connections than the test machine &mdash; optimize toward the field number. To make LCP diagnosable, PSI breaks the LCP element into four phases: <strong>TTFB</strong> (time to first byte, how long the backend takes to start sending HTML), <strong>resource load delay</strong> (how long before the browser starts fetching the LCP resource), <strong>resource load duration</strong> (how long that resource takes to download), and <strong>element render delay</strong> (how long after the resource arrives before the element paints).

      "<p>Cumulative Layout Shift is the sum of unexpected layout shifts during load, weighted by how much of the viewport moved and how far it moved.

Both terms are fractions, which is why CLS is unitless. Shifts are grouped into session windows, and the heaviest window sets the page's value, so one bad jump matters more than many tiny ones spread out. A shift within 500&nbsp;ms of, and attributable to, a user input does not count: expanding an accordion you just clicked is fine; the page lurching on its own is not.</p><p>The number you are scored on is the field 75th-percentile CLS from CrUX: real Chrome users over the trailing window. <strong>Under 0.1 is good, 0.1&ndash;0.25 needs improvement, and 0.25 and up is poor.</strong> Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights show a single lab run, and the two often disagree: the lab serves HTML faster than real users, so font swaps and lazy-image jumps fire in the field but never in the lab.

    intro:
      '<p><strong>Interaction to Next Paint (INP)</strong> is the Core Web Vital that measures responsiveness: how long the user waits between a click, tap, or keypress and the next frame the browser paints in response. It replaced First Input Delay in March 2024. Unlike its predecessor it counts the whole interaction: not just the delay before your handler runs, but the handler itself and the paint that follows. That makes it the hardest vital to game, and the one most sites still fail.</p><p>Know this before you start: INP is the metric where a server-layer optimizer helps the least. The dominant cause is JavaScript running on the main thread, and that JavaScript lives in <em>your application code</em>, not at the server. This page gives you the diagnosis workflow and fixes split by where they actually live: the few things <a href="/features/">ModPageSpeed</a> can do at the server layer, and the larger set of changes only your app can make. Then it hands you off to the per-platform guide that names the failure modes on your stack.</p>',

      '<p>INP is the worst-case latency between a user input (a click, tap, or keypress) and the next frame the browser paints in response. Chrome tracks <strong>every</strong> interaction over the page\'s lifetime and reports the 98th-percentile slowest one as that page\'s INP, so a single janky click late in a session can set the number. The good threshold is <strong>≤ 200 ms</strong> at the 75th percentile of real users; "needs improvement" runs from 200 ms to 500 ms; over 500 ms is poor.</p><p>Each interaction has three phases. <strong>Input delay</strong> is the time before your event handler starts running, usually the main thread being busy with other JavaScript. <strong>Processing time</strong> is the handler itself doing its work. <strong>Presentation delay</strong> is the time to compute layout and paint the resulting frame. Diagnosis is about finding which phase dominates the worst interaction.</p><p>One thing matters more for INP than for any other vital: <strong>use the field number, not the lab number</strong>. Real-user INP comes from CrUX (and your Search Console Core Web Vitals report). The lab approximation from Lighthouse / PageSpeed Insights is unreliable because the lab issues no human input: there is no interaction to measure, so it estimates. Optimize against the field figure; it is the only one Google ranks on and the only one worth chasing. <a href="/analyze/">Analyze a page</a> to see where it stands.</p>',
