// content-accuracy.test.ts — ANTI-DRIFT guard for drift-prone product facts in
// human-facing site copy. Prevents the recurrence of the product-fact drift
// that mps2 PR #705 (2026-06-15 sitewide accuracy sweep) removed..
//
// WHAT DRIFTED (and what this guard forbids coming back)
//   PR #705 corrected a class of confidently-wrong product statements that had
//   spread across .md/.mdx content and .astro pages:
//     - a phantom 2.0 "v1.0.0" version label (2.0 GA is v2.0.0 / current
//       website manifest semver 2.0.21 — there is NO authoritative v1.0.0; the
//       roadmap is "2.x" / "a future 2.x release");
//     - ModPageSpeed 2.0 described as a loadable / standalone nginx module
//       installable from apt/yum (it is NOT — 2.0 BUNDLES nginx 1.30.2 in its
//       Docker reverse proxy and ships via Docker + Helm + NuGet;
//       the standalone 2.0 nginx module is DEFERRED);
//     - the 1.15 native nginx module's supported nginx range stated as
//       "nginx 1.26+" (it is per-distro, pinned to each distro's STOCK nginx:
//       Deb11/Ubu22.04=1.18.0 … Deb13=1.26.3 — a closed pinned matrix, not an
//       open ">=1.26" range);
//     - an Apache el9 arm64 overclaim ("AlmaLinux/RHEL 9 (amd64 + arm64)") —
//       the yum repo is x86_64 ONLY on el9; arm64 is direct-download;
//     - (guarded since the 2026-06-15 hardening) ModPageSpeed 2.0 stated to
//       require ".NET 9" — the middleware targets net8.0 + net10.0 (ASPNETCORE_TFMS).
//
// HOW THIS GUARD WORKS
//   (1) DENYLIST — a small set of TIGHTLY-SCOPED regexes, each targeting one
//       specific wrong CLAIM while deliberately NOT matching the legitimate
//       neighbouring text that lives in the clean tree today (e.g. "1.18 to
//       1.26", "el9 (x86_64; arm64 via direct download)", "before 2.0.14",
//       libpng/Envoy dependency versions like "1.0.0"). The scan surface is the
//       SIX BUCKETS defined at SCAN_BUCKETS below (content .md/.mdx, pages
//       .astro/.ts, data .ts/.mjs, layouts, llms .tmpl templates, and the
//       generated public/ agent surface); each file is scanned line-by-line and
//       a hit FAILS with file:line:matchedText.
//   (2) PER-RULE, CLAUSE-SCOPED EXEMPTIONS — exemption is OPT-IN per rule
//       (`negationExempt` for corrective-prose tolerance, `exemptIf` for a
//       rule-specific licensing term), and BOTH are tested against the CLAUSE
//       CONTAINING THE MATCH, never the whole line. Commit 39221716 inverted the
//       old global line-level negation default: a true statement in one clause
//       must not disarm a false claim in another ("Install 2.0 from apt. 1.15
//       packages are signed too." still flags). The denylist targets AFFIRMATIVE
//       restatements of the wrong fact, NOT the corrective copy that PR #705
//       itself wrote. This is precision-over-recall by design: the guard is a
//       REGRESSION NET (§Consequences), not an exhaustive semantic
//       checker. `exemptionMustNotDisarm` probes machine-enforce the scoping.
//   (3) CANONICAL-SOURCE consistency — assert the single-sources-of-truth
//       (product-facts.mjs + the release manifests) still hold the
//       ground-truth values, so the denylist's baseline never silently rots.
//   (4) CORPUS TESTS — a fixed corpus of (a) real corrective phrasings that MUST
//       NOT be flagged (the false positives an adversarial review found), and
//       (b) engine-tag refs ("v1.1.0+r11") that MUST NOT be flagged (§5).
//   (5) MATCHER UNIT TESTS — each denylist regex is asserted to FLAG a known
//       wrong sample (and variants) AND to NOT flag a known-good sample, proving
//       the matcher discriminates without having to mutate real content.
//
// The baseline 2.0 version is DERIVED from the manifest at runtime (NOT
// hardcoded) — the manifest legitimately changes (it is 2.0.21 today).
//
// This test asserts copy/contract only; it never modifies any file.

// SCAN SURFACE. The original guard scanned only src/content/**.{md,mdx} and
// src/pages/**.astro. That left published surfaces unguarded: the two API/feed
// routes are .ts, every product CLAIM originates in src/data/**, the shared
// layout emits meta/JSON-LD prose, and the llms.txt / ai-plugin.json family is
// generated from .tmpl sources and served verbatim to agents. All of those are
// PUBLISHED, so all of them are in scope.
//
// NO PRE-PROCESSING. Lines are scanned RAW, comments included. In src/data the
// comments are load-bearing fact records ("1.15 ships AVIF via four opt-in
// filters") — a claim that drifts in a comment drifts in the reader's head and
// then in the copy. Scanning them is intended, not an accident. If a real false
// positive ever appears, REWORD THE COMMENT — do not add a comment opt-out. One
// was tried (`notInComment`) and reverted: it cost the rule that set it 41.7% of
// product-facts.mjs (the canonical fact record) and 15.6% of src/data/**, to
// accommodate exactly ONE line. Rewording that one line costs nothing and keeps
// every rule's eyes open across the whole 57k-line scan surface.

// (2) NEGATION TOLERANCE IS OPT-IN, PER RULE.
//
//   This used to be the inverse: a global ~25-token NEGATION_CONTRAST list
//   disarmed ANY rule whenever ANY negation token appeared anywhere on the
//   line. That default was backwards, and the evidence was in the rules
//   themselves — every rule authored against REAL observed drift (f1, f2, f3)
//   had to set `hardFalse: true` to escape it, because the wrong claims those
//   rules target are themselves negation-shaped ("1.15 does not ship AVIF",
//   "AVIF is 2.0-only"). A blanket token list also disarms on an INCIDENTAL
//   negation elsewhere in the sentence, which is a silent hole by construction.
//
//   Now: negation exempts NOTHING by default. A rule that genuinely needs
//   corrective-prose tolerance sets `negationExempt`, and that regex carries the
//   SPECIFIC corrective phrasing for THAT claim — not a generic token list. Only
//   three rules need it (a, b2, b3); f1/f2/f3 need nothing, and c/d/e are
//   already cleared by their own regex directionality and `exemptIf`.

// plus a known-bad sample (must flag), a known-good sample (must not flag), and
// optional extra variants exercised by the matcher tests.
//
// SCOPING NOTES (false positives deliberately avoided — verified against the
// clean PR-#705 tree AND an adversarial false-positive corpus, see FP_CORPUS):
//   - Rule a does NOT bare-match "1.0.0": libpng 1.6.x, Envoy and other
//     dependency versions legitimately use x.y.z including "1.0.0". It only
//     matches phantom 2.0 version-label phrasings.
//   - Rule b3 is FORWARD-only ("ModPageSpeed 2.0" is the SUBJECT of the apt/yum
//     claim): the reverse direction ("1.15 ships apt and yum … 2.0 ships Docker")
//     is the common legitimate contrast and must not fire.
//   - Rule c keys on the OPEN-range expression ("1.26+", "1.26 or newer", ">=1.26"),
//     NOT "1.18 to 1.26" / "stock nginx 1.26.3".
//   - Rule d keys on the explicit "(amd64 + arm64)" overclaim attached to el9 /
//     RHEL 9 / AlmaLinux 9, OR an affirmative verb tying arm64 INTO the el9 yum
//     repo — NOT a correct arch-split description ("yum is x86_64 only; arm64 via
//     apt/direct download"), which the token order + the negation exemption clear.

// (6) CANARY FIXTURES — prove the SCAN PATH itself still works.
//
//   The matcher unit tests above call isFlaggedByRule() on string literals, so
//   they bypass the scanner entirely: the walker, the extension filter and the
//   line splitter are all unexercised by them. If walk() silently stopped
//   returning files, if an extension dropped out of a bucket, or if the line
//   splitter broke, every one of those tests would still pass and the guard
//   would be green while scanning nothing.
//
//   The canaries close that gap. test/fixtures/canary/<rule-id>.md each hold
//   that rule's `bad` sample on a known line, and live under test/** so they
//   are OUTSIDE SCAN_FILES (they would otherwise self-flag the real guard).
//   They are then scanned with the SAME walk() and the SAME scan function, and
//   each rule must produce exactly one hit at exactly the expected line.
