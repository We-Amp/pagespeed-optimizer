// release-notes-ids-gate.test.ts — pre-deploy gate for the converged
// /docs/release-notes/ page's id contract: every era heading, every
// release-entry <details id>, every legacy `<span id>` alias carried
// forward from the pages this one replaced, and the two preserved
// upstream-bridge ids must resolve in the BUILT page. Reads the production
// BUILD output (dist/client), not the MDX source, so it catches anything
// that could drop an id between content and render — the same reasoning as
// anchor-gate.test.ts, which this file otherwise deliberately mirrors (own
// fixture, own test: the two id sets serve different pages and evolve
// independently).
//
// This is the STRONGER, run-after-a-build check — not the CI gate. CI's
// unit-test job runs `npx vitest run` without a preceding `npm run build`,
// and dist/ is gitignored, so this test SKIPS itself (never throws) when
// dist/client/docs/release-notes does not exist, rather than redding every
// PR. Run it explicitly after a build with
// `npx vitest run test/release-notes-ids-gate.test.ts`, or as part of
// `npm run build && npm run test:unit`.
//
// Extend test/fixtures/release-notes-ids.txt (append-only, never remove a
// row) whenever a later content pass adds a new id to the page.
