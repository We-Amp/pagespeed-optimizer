## Before/after evidence for a change

`scripts/visual-diff.mjs` compares two locally served builds, a base and a head. It is opt-in and local: it is not part of `npx vitest run` or `npx playwright test`, and it never builds or starts a server.

Build each side in its own checkout with its own build id, and serve each on an explicit free port:

```
SITE_BUILD_ID=base-<short sha> PRICING_ALLOW_STALE=1 npm run build
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=<free port> node dist/server/entry.mjs
```

Screenshots (full page, dark, at 1440x900, 820x1180 and 390x844):

```
node scripts/visual-diff.mjs shots --base http://127.0.0.1:<port> --head http://127.0.0.1:<port> \
  --base-id base-<short sha> --head-id head-<short sha> --out <dir> [--paths <file>] [path...]
```

Without paths it shoots a default set of twelve pages, which includes `/error/404/` and `/error/500/`: the node server answers an unknown URL with a redirect stub, so the designed error pages are reviewed at those two paths. The script checks the `<meta name="build-id">` each origin serves and refuses to run when an id does not match, when the two ids are equal or when an origin is not a loopback address. `<dir>` receives `base/`, `head/` and `diff/` images, `table.md` (`page | viewport | changed %`), `report.json` and `index.html` (a contact sheet). Captures are deterministic: reduced motion, animations off, device scale factor 1, fixed date, empty storage, requests to other hosts refused, fonts and lazy images loaded, the page unscrolled. The telemetry strip and the footer copyright line are masked (`--mask <selector>` adds more), so a change inside them does not show. `--fail-on-diff` exits 1 on any changed pixel, for a change that must not move anything. Two builds of the same commit give 0 changed pixels; a pair that differs is shot again up to twice, because a few antialiased edge pixels can round differently between two captures.

Normalized build-output diff (prerendered HTML and built CSS, after the scoped-style ids, hashed bundle names and the build-id tag are stripped; CSS is compared rule by rule):

```
node scripts/visual-diff.mjs dist --base <base checkout>/website --head <head checkout>/website
```

It prints what differs and exits 1, or `normalized dist diff: empty` and exits 0. On-demand routes are not in `dist/`; the screenshots cover those.
