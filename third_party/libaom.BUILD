# libaom - AV1 codec library (encoder + decoder)
# Built via cmake_build rule invoking cmake directly.  The previous
# rules_foreign_cc cmake() wrapper is broken on Windows
# (pkgconfig_tool_msvc_build fails).  libaom needs cmake for
# arch-specific SIMD feature detection.
#
# Requires on PATH: cmake, a C/C++ compiler, Perl (for RTCD headers).
# On Windows: MSVC (via vcvars64), Ninja, and MSYS2 coreutils.
