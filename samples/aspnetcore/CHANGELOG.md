# Changelog

## 2.0.20

### Middleware read-back

The `ReadResult.OriginCcFlags` property now exposes the origin Cache-Control
directives as a bitfield (PS_CC_ORIGIN_*), and `ReadResult.RevalidationRequired`
correctly derives the revalidation requirement from these flags. For a private
cache (ASP.NET in-process), only `no-cache` and `must-revalidate` trigger
revalidation; `proxy-revalidate` and `s-maxage` are ignored per RFC 9111
§5.2.2.9-10.

The middleware write path now persists the origin Cache-Control state using
`ps_parse_cache_control`, so cache entries carry the true origin-revalidation
signal and aggressive-mode `stale-if-error` is correctly suppressed when the
origin requires revalidation.

### Constants

Added `CacheControlCcFlags` class with all 14 PS_CC_ORIGIN_* bit constants
(`NoCache`, `MustRevalidate`, `NoStore`, `Private`, `Public`, `Immutable`,
`SMaxagePresent`, `ProxyRevalidate`, `NoTransform`, `HeaderPresent`,
`PrivateQualified`, `PrivateBare`, `NoCacheQualified`, `NoCacheBare`).

## 2.0.19

README alignment with the always-functional licensing model.
Docs-only - no middleware or worker code change versus 2.0.18.

### README

The on-NuGet README still described the previous model ("no-op until a trial
or license is activated"). It now matches shipped behavior: optimization runs
out of the box, unlicensed responses carry an `X-PageSpeed-Warn: unlicensed`
header, and production use requires a license (the software never
locks you out). No behavior change.

## 2.0.18

Product enhancements and changes around license handling. See the release
notes at https://modpagespeed.com/.

## 2.0.17

Various bug fixes and enhancements. No public API change versus 2.0.16.

## 2.0.16

README clarity release. Docs-only - no middleware or worker code change
versus 2.0.15.

### README

The on-NuGet README implied two different things about a fresh install:
the Quick Start said "HTML and image optimization are on out of the box,"
while the trial step noted (lower down) that "without a license token,
requests pass through unchanged." A reader hit the first claim before the
second. The README now states up front - in the lead, at the end of the
setup step, and at the top of the trial step - that the middleware is a
no-op until a trial or license is activated, and that the worker
auto-start ("out of the box") refers to the plumbing, not to optimization
being applied. No behavior change.

## 2.0.7

NuGet page + build-metadata polish. No functional change to the
middleware or worker versus 2.0.6.

### README

The on-NuGet README now links to modpagespeed.com in the lead paragraph,
the activation step, and the Links section.

### Build metadata (PDBs + nuget.info health flags)

`samples/aspnetcore/Directory.Build.props` now sets `<Deterministic>true</Deterministic>`
and `<ContinuousIntegrationBuild Condition="'$(CI)' == 'true'">true</ContinuousIntegrationBuild>`.
Two effects:

- The **Non deterministic** and **Compiler Flags: Missing** checks on
  [nuget.info](https://nuget.info/packages/WeAmp.PageSpeed.AspNetCore)
  flip green.
- Absolute source paths from CI workers (`/Users/.../modpagespeed-2/…`)
  no longer get embedded in shipped PDBs.

The third nuget.info health flag, **Source Link: Missing Symbols**,
remains intentionally red - turning Source Link on would advertise commit SHAs and per-file paths in
PDBs that consumers could not resolve at the time.

## 2.0.6

Republish of 2.0.5 with a corrected worker version string. The v2.0.5
hotfix bumped `<Version>` in `Directory.Build.props` but missed the
matching `kPageSpeedVersion` in `src/product_version/version.h` and
the top-level `VERSION.txt`, so the bundled `factory_worker` reported
`version: "2.0.4"` on `/v1/health` (and in the heartbeat telemetry that
feeds the compliance report) on every 2.0.5 install.

No functional change to the trial/activation flow versus 2.0.5 - this
is purely a version-string + provenance correction. The three sources
of truth are now pinned together by a new xUnit invariant test
(`VersionInvariantTests`) that runs on every PR.

## 2.0.5

Hotfix - trial + paid activation were both broken on a stock 2.0.4 install.
Verified end-to-end against the live license service.

### What was broken

- `WorkerProcessHost` never passed `--license-renewal-url` to the worker
  and `WorkerOptions` had no property for it. Every `POST /v1/license/trial`
  and `/v1/license/activate` returned `503 License service URL not
  configured` - the upstream call was never even attempted.
- The NuGet `factory_worker` correctly stamps `server: "aspnetcore"` on its
  tracking metadata (set by `--copt=-DPAGESPEED_SERVER='"aspnetcore"'` in
  #377), but the license-service allow-list was not updated alongside, so
  even with the URL wired up upstream returns `400 invalid server:
  aspnetcore`.

### Fix

- New `WorkerOptions.LicenseRenewalUrl` (default
  `https://api.modpagespeed.com`). Override only for staging/self-hosted
  license services. Empty disables every license-proxy endpoint.
- Matching license-service allow-list update shipped in lockstep

## 2.0.4

The in-app workbench is back, served by the middleware. Trial activation
works out of the box - `dotnet add package`, `dotnet run`, navigate to
`/console/`, enter your email, get a 14-day trial token.

### Console + license endpoints on the app port

- `GET /console/*` - the SvelteKit workbench SPA is now embedded in
  `WeAmp.PageSpeed.AspNetCore.dll` and served by the middleware. No more
  Worker.ApiPort setup, no extra port to expose, no files in `wwwroot/`.
  The mount path is configurable via `Console.MountPath` (default `/console`).
- `POST /v1/license/trial`, `POST /v1/license/apply`, and related license
  endpoints are now proxied through the middleware to the worker. CSRF gate
  preserved (`Content-Type: application/json` + `X-Requested-With:
  XMLHttpRequest` still required).
- `Worker.ApiPort` semantics changed from "0 = disabled" to "0 = auto-pick
  a loopback ephemeral port at startup". Explicit values still bind on the
  configured port. The worker HTTP API is never exposed externally unless
  you opt in.

### Metadata + packaging

- NOTICE and THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES are now packed in every `.nupkg`. Apache-2.0
  attribution for the statically-linked LLVM libc++/libc++abi/libunwind is
  now in THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.
- Package icon, release notes, and Core-Web-Vitals-led description are now
  set on the nuget.org listing.
- RepositoryUrl is properly stripped from the .nupkg metadata (SourceLink
  auto-detection disabled).

### Security note

The `/console/` workbench and `/v1/license/*` proxy are served on the same
origin as your app. The worker's CSRF gate blocks cross-origin form posts
but does not protect against same-origin XSS / supply-chain scripts that can
drive `POST /v1/license/trial`. Set `Console.RequireHttps = true` in
production, gate `/console/` at your reverse proxy if you can't trust every
script loaded into the app, and use `Console.MountPath` to move the path
off a guessable location. A one-time CSRF token for trial activation is
planned for a follow-up release. See README "Security" section for details.

### Telemetry attribution

- The bundled `factory_worker` now reports `server=aspnetcore` and
  `distribution=nuget` in heartbeats (was `nginx`/`source`), so compliance
  reports can segment NuGet installs as a distinct distribution channel.
  All four RIDs (linux-x64, linux-arm64, osx-arm64, win-x64) are stamped
  consistently via `PAGESPEED_SERVER` / `PAGESPEED_DISTRIBUTION` copts.
- `WeAmp.PageSpeed.NativeAssets.*` packages now embed a `BUILD_INFO.json`
  at `runtimes/<rid>/native/BUILD_INFO.json` with `git_sha`,
  `git_sha_short`, `build_timestamp_utc`, and `rid`. Supports
  correlating compliance-report heartbeats with a specific package build
  and verifying provenance without unpacking the `.nupkg`.
- `/v1/health` now emits `expired` alongside `valid` in the license block,
  matching the field the middleware reads. The middleware logs a one-shot
  warning if the field is absent, which indicates a NativeAssets package
  pinned to a pre-2.0.4 worker (in which case expiry enforcement
  silently collapses to valid-only - bump NativeAssets to match).

## 2.0.3

Hotfix for 2.0.2's broken linux-x64 binary (GLIBC_2.38 baseline → failed
on RHEL 9 / Debian 12 / Ubuntu 22.04). **2.0.2 has been unlisted from
nuget.org**; pinned references should bump to 2.0.3.

Root cause: `release.yml`'s linux-build job used a static
`pagespeed2-dev:latest` Docker tag instead of the content-hashed image
mechanism. The new Ubuntu 22.04 build environment from 2.0.2 never
reached the linux-x64 binary. Fixed in this release; future Dockerfile
changes will auto-propagate.

linux-arm64, osx-arm64, and win-x64 in 2.0.2 were correct.

## 2.0.2

Packaging-correctness release. `dotnet add package WeAmp.PageSpeed.AspNetCore`
followed by `dotnet run` now works end-to-end - no `dotnet publish` required.

### Linux native binaries are now self-contained

- `WeAmp.PageSpeed.NativeAssets.Linux` ships only `libpagespeed.so` and
  `factory_worker`. libc++/libc++abi/libunwind are statically linked into
  both.
- 2.0.1 shipped these as separate `.so` files. NuGet's restore-time
  native-asset detection silently dropped `libc++.so.1` and `libc++abi.so.1`
  (filenames combining `++` with a `.so.N` version suffix hit an
  auto-detect regex edge case), so `libpagespeed.so` failed to load with
  "libc++.so.1: cannot open shared object file" on consumer machines.

### Worker

- `/v1/health` now reports the actual package version. 2.0.0 and 2.0.1
  both reported `"version": "2.0.0-beta.1"` due to a stale literal.

### LICENSE

- `Licensed Work` field changed from the pre-GA placeholder
  `PageSpeed 2.0 0.1.0` to `ModPageSpeed 2.0`.
- `Change Date` corrected to `2030-05-17` (four years from 2.0.0 GA).

## 2.0.1

Packaging and metadata fixes on top of 2.0.0. No runtime behavior changes.

### Packaging

- `WeAmp.PageSpeed.AspNetCore` now transitively pulls in the matching
  `WeAmp.PageSpeed.NativeAssets.*` package via `WeAmp.PageSpeed`. Consumers
  install a single package and the native binaries for their RID resolve
  automatically.
- `WeAmp.PageSpeed.NativeAssets.*` packages no longer ship
  `runtimes/<rid>/native/console/index.html`. The 2.0.0 stub extracted to the
  publish-output root and collided with consumer assets; the workbench SPA
  will be repackaged in a follow-up release. The `POST /v1/license/trial`
  endpoint, served directly by the middleware, is the supported trial
  activation path for 2.0.1.

### Metadata

- Package `projectUrl` now points at the ASP.NET Core feature section on
  modpagespeed.com.
- Removed `<RepositoryUrl>` from package metadata.
- README rewritten: simpler install (single package), explicit trial
  activation step, accurate description of worker IPC (Unix domain sockets on
  Linux/macOS, Windows Named Pipes on win-x64 - earlier text incorrectly said
  "HTTP polling fallback").

## 2.0.0

First General Availability release of `WeAmp.PageSpeed.AspNetCore`. Bumps the
NuGet package version from `2.0.0-preview.1` to `2.0.0`.

### Distribution

- Signed packages via Microsoft Trusted Signing (Public Trust certificate).
- nuget.org Trusted Publishing - short-lived OIDC credentials, no long-lived
  API key in the repo.

### Configuration reference rewritten

- Every option in `aspnet-configuration.md` now matches `PageSpeedOptions.cs`
  source. Removed previously-documented options that did not exist
  (`RewriteLevel`, `EnabledFilters`, `DisabledFilters`, `StatisticsEnabled`,
  `ConsolePath`, flat `CachePath`); added the real `Cache`, `Html`, and
  `Worker` nested-options tables.
- `Worker.ApiPort` documentation now includes an explicit security warning:
  never expose the worker management API to the public internet (no auth).

### Bug fixes

- Middleware no longer emits `stale-if-error` unconditionally; gated by the
  origin response's revalidation directives (`must-revalidate`, `no-cache`,
  `proxy-revalidate`, `s-maxage`) per RFC 9111 §4.2.4. (#259)
- Worker `SetLicenseStatus` writes are now atomic via a mutex; HTTP readers
  on `/v1/health` and `/api/status` cannot observe torn license state under
  the new hot-path enforcement. (#167)

## 2.0.0-preview.1

### Breaking Changes

- All `IPageSpeedCache` methods now require a `scheme` parameter ("http" or "https")
- IPC wire protocol bumped to v3 (incompatible with older components)
- Cache keys changed format (full invalidation on upgrade)

### Fixes

- ASP.NET middleware URL now correctly uses path+query only (no scheme://host prefix)
- Worker notification dedup key now includes scheme and hostname
