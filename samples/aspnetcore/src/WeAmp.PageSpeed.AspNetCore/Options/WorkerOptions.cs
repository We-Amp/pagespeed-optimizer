    //      v2.0.14 fix: the historical default of null silently disabled
    //      notifications, so notifications.received / variants.written stayed 0
    //      and the Dashboard / Savings / Metrics pages showed zeros forever.
    //   2. Assigned a non-null path → honor it verbatim.
    //   3. Assigned null explicitly (in code OR via "SocketPath": null in
    //      configuration) → coordination disabled. This is the documented
    //      escape hatch for genuinely worker-less hosts.
    //
    // The resolved auto-path is memoized per instance. Note that IOptions and
    // IOptionsMonitor hand out DISTINCT WorkerOptions instances, so the worker
    // host and the notification service do NOT share this memoized value — the
    // host pins the value it launches the worker with into the shared
    // InternalWorkerEndpoint, and the notification service reads it back from
    // there. The memoization here only guarantees the value is stable across
    // repeated reads on a single instance.
