# compile_commands.json generation for clang-tidy / clangd. Wraps hedron's
# default refresh_all (@hedron_compile_commands//:refresh_all is
# refresh_compile_commands with no targets, i.e. {"@//...": ""}) because
# targets tagged `manual` — the fuzz harnesses — are excluded from the
# `//...` wildcard in `bazel aquery`, so their TUs never reach
# compile_commands.json. The lint lane's scoped mode then selects 0 TUs for
# a PR touching only such a file and trips the #1094 fail-closed guard.
# Explicit labels are NOT affected by the manual-tag wildcard exclusion, so
# listing them here puts their compile actions back in the database.
# Maintenance: add future `manual`-tagged cc targets to this dict.
