# Signs and verifies a release's SHA256SUMS with the We-Amp release signing
# key (see docs/ci/release.md). Both commands name the key by its full
# fingerprint and fail on any other key.
#
# Usage:
#   RELEASE_GPG_KEY=<base64 of the armored secret key> \
#   RELEASE_GPG_PASSPHRASE=<passphrase> \
#     tools/ci/release_checksums_sig.sh sign <SHA256SUMS> <SHA256SUMS.asc>
#   tools/ci/release_checksums_sig.sh verify <SHA256SUMS> <SHA256SUMS.asc> <public key file>
#
# sign:   imports the secret into a throwaway GNUPGHOME, refuses unless it
#         holds exactly one secret key whose fingerprint is the release key,
#         writes a detached armored signature, and removes the keyring.
# verify: imports only <public key file> into a fresh GNUPGHOME (the file
#         must hold exactly one key, the release key) and requires the
#         VALIDSIG primary-key fingerprint to be the release key exactly.
#
# RELEASE_KEY_FPR overrides the pinned fingerprint, and is honoured only
# together with RELEASE_SIG_SELF_TEST=1, which only the self-test
# (tools/ci/test_release_checksums_sig.sh) sets. Anywhere else an override is
# refused, so a stray environment variable can never change the pin.
#
# The pin is a consistency check between the signing secret and the
# committed RELEASE-SIGNING-KEY.asc, not an independent trust root: whoever
# can change main can change both.
