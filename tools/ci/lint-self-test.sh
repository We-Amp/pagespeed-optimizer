# Self-test for the lint pipeline.
#
# Runs the `lint-compile-commands.sh` script the CI Lint job uses and
# asserts that the resulting compile_commands.json is fit for
# clang-tidy. Catches regressions that would otherwise surface as
# FileNotFoundError minutes into a CI Lint job.
#
# This is a smoke test, not a unit test — it requires the full lint
# Docker image and a vendored workspace. Invoke from inside the
# pagespeed2-lint container (as the CI Lint job does):
#
#     docker run --rm \
#       -v $(pwd):/workspace \
#       -v $HOME/.cache/bazel:/root/.cache/bazel \
#       -v $HOME/bazel-repo-cache:/root/bazel-repo-cache \
#       -v $HOME/.ssh/<ci-key>:/tmp/ssh_key:ro \
#       --add-host=bazel-remote-cache:${BAZEL_CACHE_HOST} \
#       pagespeed2-lint:latest \
#       bash -c 'cp /tmp/ssh_key /root/.ssh/ci_key && chmod 600 /root/.ssh/ci_key \
#         && ssh-keyscan -H github.com >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts 2>/dev/null \
#         && export GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i /root/.ssh/ci_key" \
#         && /workspace/tools/ci/lint-self-test.sh'
#
# GIT_SSH_COMMAND is required: ssh only auto-loads default identity names
# (id_rsa, id_ed25519, ...), so a key copied to ci_key is otherwise ignored and
# the git fetches this test triggers fall back to no key and fail.
