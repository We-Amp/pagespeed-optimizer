# The release lanes' CI gate: a green run of ci.yml for the release commit
# must exist before a release lane builds or publishes. Accepted run: a
# ci.yml run on main with head_sha = RELEASE_SHA, event push or
# workflow_dispatch, conclusion success, in which every job of the list in
# REQUIRED below is success and no other job is failure, cancelled or
# timed_out (the arm64 daemon privilege rig is the one job allowed to be red;
# it is continue-on-error in ci.yml). A full=true dispatch satisfies this. A
# push run whose pull-request tier was skipped does not, by design.
#
#   * Every API call is retried on a transient failure (HTTP 5xx, timeouts,
#     connection errors) with backoff 10/20/40/80 s; a 4xx is not retried.
#     When the retries run out the gate refuses (fail closed).
#   * A run still queued or in progress is waited for, up to MAX_WAIT_SECONDS.
#   * Two consecutive checks that find completed runs and no passing one
#     refuse; an empty page or an in-flight run resets that streak.
#   * On DRY_RUN=true a refusal is a ::warning:: and the exit code is 0.
