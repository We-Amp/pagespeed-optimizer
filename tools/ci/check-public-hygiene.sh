# Public-tree hygiene gate (BLOCKING) -- the "Public-tree hygiene gate" CI
# job. This repository is public, so the tracked tree must stay free of
# private-infrastructure and private-process vocabulary: internal
# decision-record references, the private CI runner-pool label scheme,
# pre-publication development repository slugs, internal work-item
# identifiers and private build-fleet topology words. Direct commits to
# this repository never pass through the private source repos' export-time
# filters, so the classes are re-checked here, against public-safe patterns
# only.
#
# The rules live in .github/hygiene-rules.txt (one "<flags><TAB><ERE>" per
# line; its header documents each class). Every rule is run over the
# tracked tree with git grep; ANY hit fails the job and prints path:line.
#
# Excluded from the scan:
#   * .git -- git grep visits tracked files only, so it is never scanned.
#   * the rules file itself -- it necessarily contains every blocked
#     pattern.
#   * tools/async-css-probe/fixtures/modpagespeed-com/index.html -- a
#     byte-frozen capture of the modpagespeed.com home page (sha256-pinned
#     per file in its CAPTURE.md, so it can be neither edited nor
#     re-captured without breaking the pin). Its recorded marketing copy
#     uses one of the blocked topology words in the product-positioning
#     sense ("runs on your servers"), not the CI-fleet sense the rule
#     targets. This is the ONLY content exclusion; any other hit anywhere
#     in the tree fails.
#
# Usage: tools/ci/check-public-hygiene.sh
