# Expand a PR's changed files into the set of translation units clang-tidy must
# lint.
#
# A changed .cc is its own TU. A changed header is not a TU at all, so it is
# resolved to the .cc files that include it, transitively, since a header may
# reach a .cc only through other headers. Without the transitive step a change
# to a widely-included base header would lint almost nothing.
#
# Run inside the lint container with cwd = the source tree. Prints one path per
# line on stdout, sorted and de-duplicated; prints nothing when the scope is
# empty. The caller must treat no output as "skip clang-tidy", never as "lint
# everything".
#
# Usage: lint-scope-expand.sh <changed-cc-list> <changed-header-list> [compdb]
#
# Includes in this tree are repo-relative and quoted
# (#include "lib/net/ssrf_guard.h"), so a fixed-string grep for the quoted
# path is exact: no basename ambiguity between same-named headers in different
# directories. A repo header spelled with angle brackets is matched too. Bare
# quoted includes (#include "png.h") name third-party headers and never match
# a repo-relative path.
#
# When a compilation database path is given, the result is intersected with its
# "file" entries. A TU absent from the database would lint nothing and exit 0,
# a false green, so it is dropped here rather than handed to run-clang-tidy.
#
# No mapfile and no `declare -A`: this must also run under the macOS system
# bash 3.2 that the local reproduction path uses.
