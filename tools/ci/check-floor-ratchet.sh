# check-floor-ratchet.sh - forward-only floor enforcement for the vendored
# kernel pins (#1104; reused by the #1130 HTML kernel vendoring
# via --main-pin-path lib/html/HTML_KERNEL_PIN).
#
# The pin file (lib/js/JS_KERNEL_PIN, or --main-pin-path's target) records a
# `floor <sha>` line: the pin-downgrade ratchet. The sync tool enforces
# pin >= floor; THIS script enforces that the floor itself only ever moves
# forward relative to origin/main, and that the floor line cannot be deleted
# or duplicated.
#
# Two callers, one logic:
#   * CI's js-kernel-differential job (--mode
#     required): the REQUIRED merge gate. Tree-local validity + equality
#     need no canonical-repo access; an actual floor MOVE verifies
#     ancestry in the canonical 1.15 repo (persistent mirror, then a
#     one-shot clone) and FAILS CLOSED if it is unreachable — floor moves
#     only happen on pin bumps, so the network dependency sits in the
#     rare path.
#   * the JS-kernel drift check's RATCHET step (--mode
#     drift): same validity + equality unconditionally; for a MOVE it
#     uses the canonical source the reach ladder already selected
#     (--canonical). With no source it mirrors the drift job's own
#     semantics: warn-pass on pull_request, fail otherwise.
#
# Main-side floor states (F2): ok (present + valid) / absent (no floor
# line: pull_request-only bootstrap notice-pass, every other event fails —
# once the ratchet has shipped, absent-on-main means main regressed) /
# invalid (malformed or duplicated line: always fail closed).
#
# Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 fail. All failure text goes to stderr with GitHub
# annotations (plain text when run locally).
