# stage-docker-cli.sh -- stage a Linux docker CLI + compose plugin where the
# Docker DAEMON can bind-mount them, and print shell assignments for
# DOCKER_BIN and COMPOSE_PLUGIN. Usage in a workflow step:
#
#   eval "$(tools/ci/stage-docker-cli.sh)"
#   docker run ... -v "$DOCKER_BIN":/usr/bin/docker:ro \
#                  -v "$COMPOSE_PLUGIN":/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose:ro ...
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Compose-based lanes run pytest inside a throwaway container and hand it the
#   host's docker CLI by bind mount. A bind-mount source path is resolved by the
#   DAEMON, not by the shell that runs `docker run`. When the runner is a Linux
#   container (or a macOS shell) whose daemon is Docker Desktop, the daemon
#   host is the Desktop VM, which has no /usr/bin/docker: Docker then creates
#   an EMPTY DIRECTORY at the mount source and the test process fails with
#   `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'docker'` (exec of a
#   directory). On a bare-metal Linux runner the runner host is the daemon host
#   and the mount just works -- which is why the defect only shows on Desktop-
#   backed runners.
#
#   The one path every runner shape shares with its daemon is the runner's own
#   work directory (the repo checkout is bind-mounted from it on every lane
#   already), so the CLI and plugin are copied under $RUNNER_TEMP and mounted
#   from there. Linux runners copy their host binaries; macOS runners (darwin
#   host binaries cannot run in a Linux container) download the Linux static
#   builds for the daemon's architecture, as the periodic lanes already did.
