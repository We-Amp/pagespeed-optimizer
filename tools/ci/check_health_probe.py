"""CI check: the container health probes wait as long as they claim to.

The Compose files and the Helm chart probe the optimizer's health socket with
socat. The optimizer writes one status line when the connection is accepted,
so the probe's deadline is however long socat waits for that line. Two things
decide that, and neither is the probe's `timeout`:

  * a probe that pipes an (empty) stdin into a two-way socat sees end of input
    at once, and socat then closes 0.5 s later (its `-t` default) -- a busy
    optimizer that answers after 0.6 s is reported unhealthy;
  * a one-way probe (`-u`) waits for the socket, bounded by `-T`.

Part 1 (always runs) reads every shipped probe and requires the one-way form
with an explicit `-T` that sits inside the probe's own timeout.

Part 2 (needs socat; skipped without it unless CHECK_HEALTH_PROBE_REQUIRED=1)
runs each probe command against a stand-in health socket that answers at once,
answers after 2 s, and never answers, and checks exit status and elapsed time.
