# shadow-css-oracle.sh — full-shadow comparison for the glue-normalization
# cutover (#1238): build the PRE-cutover token-oracle comparator from one
# git revision and the POST-cutover comparator from a source tree, replay
# every input unit in the given dirs through BOTH binaries, and require
# 100% per-input verdict agreement.
#
# The cutover replaces the N hand-grown edge rules in
# lib/css/css_token_stream.h with Normalize(x) = Phase2(Phase1(x)) plus a
# glue-free extractor. The spike (css-triage-1238 glue-normalization
# report) made "one nightly in shadow before cutover" the adoption gate:
# the old and new comparators must return the SAME verdict (clean vs
# oracle-trip) on every real evidence unit — fuzz corpus, crash
# artifacts, minimized repros, embedded seeds — before the new machinery
# may replace the old. This script is that gate, runnable both locally
# and from the CSS-fuzz lane's shadow job.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/ci/shadow-css-oracle.sh SRC_DIR OLD_REV INPUT_DIR [INPUT_DIR...]
#
#   SRC_DIR   post-cutover source tree (the PR checkout)
#   OLD_REV   git rev resolvable in SRC_DIR holding the baseline
#             comparator (the scheduled job pins the last RATIFIED
#             comparator rev — currently 1c2976215, bumped after the
#             #1245 cutover + #1246 `.0.`-guard transitions; bump it
#             DELIBERATELY in the same PR as any intentional comparator
#             evolution, or the lane hard-fails on every intentional
#             divergence). May also be a directory holding an
#             already-extracted old source tree (useful where SRC_DIR
#             is not a working git repo, e.g. an rsynced scratch copy).
#   INPUT_DIR dirs walked recursively for input units (fuzz corpus, crash
#             artifacts, dumped seeds); every regular file is one input
#
# Verdicts are compared as booleans (rc==0 "clean" vs rc!=0 "trip") — the
# exact failure code differs by oracle (strict vs token vs sanitizer) and
# is not part of the contract. Exit: 0 = 100% agreement, 1 = at least one
# disagreement, 2 = usage error or zero inputs compared.
#
# Build wiring mirrors the fuzz workflow: direct clang++ compile of the
# standalone harness (NOT bazel — see the css-fuzz.yml header). CXX is
# overridable; default clang++-20 as on the self-hosted runner.
