"""Static origin for the async-CSS probe.

The fixture directory mirrors the captured site's URL space: a file at
``<fixture>/a/b.css`` is served at ``/a/b.css``, and ``index.html`` at the
fixture root is served at ``/`` (see ``fixtures/modpagespeed-com/CAPTURE.md``).
One rule, no per-asset special cases — a capture refresh drops files at the
path the page asks for and they are served, which is what adding the fonts and
logos needed.

The route table is still built once at startup from what is on disk, and
anything not in it is a 404. That is deliberate: the fold must render from
frozen bytes, so a path the capture does not contain has to fail loudly rather
than be improvised.

Deliberately dumb: no conditional requests, no ranges, no programmable routes.
The probe is about what the optimizer does to a realistic page, so the origin
must contribute nothing of its own. The one thing it does contribute is a
cacheable response — without ``Cache-Control`` the optimizer has nothing to
store, and the deferral decision never runs.
