"""Fixtures for the async-CSS probe.

Manages the origin / worker / nginx compose trio, warms the cache in the order
the deferral decision requires, and hands the tests a parsed view of the served
markup.

The harness runs the same fixture three ways, selected by
``ASYNC_CSS_PROBE_MODE``. Each mode differs only in the worker's argv:

``gated``    the sufficiency floor is raised so the gate REFUSES to defer.
             Asserts nothing is deferred, and no loader is injected.

``forced``   the same raised floor PLUS ``--unsafe-force-async-css``. Asserts the
             deferred markup is correct in every part.

``shipped``  stock flags. Records what the product does today on this page, so
             the lane notices when PR-C changes it.

``gated`` and ``forced`` differ by exactly one flag, so the pair is what proves
the switch does what it claims end to end — and what proves the gate, not luck,
is what suppresses deferral in ``gated``. A single mode could show neither.
