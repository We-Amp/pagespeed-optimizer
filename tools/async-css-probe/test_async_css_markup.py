"""Markup lane: what the optimizer emits for a deferred stylesheet.

Hermetic and browser-free. Every assertion is about bytes and headers the
server produced, so a red run is a product change, never a rendering
difference. The infrastructure underneath is another matter — see the CI job's
recovery steps.

Three modes, selected by ASYNC_CSS_PROBE_MODE (see conftest.py):

* ``TestGateRefuses`` — floor raised, switch off: nothing defers, and with the
  stylesheet staying render-blocking the page carries no inline critical block
  either (the block is only worth its bytes when it replaces the blocking
  fetch).
* ``TestForcedDeferral`` — floor raised, switch on: it defers, and every piece
  of the deferred markup must be correct. The pair is the switch's end-to-end
  proof, and the gate's.
* ``TestForcedRefusesBroadRule`` — the same switch on a page whose stylesheet
  the optimizer will not inline (see below): nothing is inlined or deferred.

* ``TestShippedConfiguration`` — stock flags: what the product does today.

Two fixture pages. The primary one (modpagespeed.com, Tailwind v4) carries
`@property ... syntax:"<color>"` in its stylesheet, and the optimizer never
inlines CSS that holds a `<` followed by a letter, `/`, `!` or `?`: that page
gets no inline critical block and its stylesheet stays render-blocking in every
mode, the switch included. The second ("plain", stock Bootstrap 5.3.3) has no
such sequence, so it is the page the deferral and its inline block are checked
on. Tests are routed to the page that matches them; the invariants that hold
for both run on both.

        to the fold and to the variant's viewport class. Equal-specificity
        ties resolve by source order, so a block AFTER a sheet wins them for
        good once the sheet applies: a responsive override the block dropped
        loses to the base rule the block kept. So the block goes
        before every stylesheet source. A layer's position is fixed by its
        first mention, so a block that names a cascade layer goes first only
        with an `@layer ...;` statement in front that lists the page's layers
        in document order, when the worker can prove that order; otherwise it
        keeps the old placement, after every head stylesheet. This test runs
        on the plain page, whose Bootstrap sheet names no cascade layer, so it
        checks the placement before every stylesheet source and no longer
        exercises the `@layer` statement branch. Either way the block follows
