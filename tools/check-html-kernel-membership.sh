# check-html-kernel-membership.sh - explicit-membership gate for lib/html/.
#
# The style-lint and license carve-outs for the vendored HTML kernel key on
# an EXPLICIT name list (lib/html has no uniform vendored-name prefix, and
# optimizer-owned files like html_metadata_extractor share the html_* shape).
# Names alone are spoofable: a hand-planted lib/html/html_node_evil.cc would
# dodge nothing, but a hand-edited SYNCED_FILES.txt or a stray file would
# blur the vendored/owned boundary. This script makes membership EXPLICIT
# and locally verifiable — no canonical-repo access needed:
#
#   * lib/html/SYNCED_FILES.txt (written by tools/sync-html-kernel.sh as
#     part of the synced output) lists every file the sync produced;
#   * a closed set of 2.0-owned files is declared below (compat shims,
#     build/docs/pin/license, and the optimizer-native lib/html files);
#   * every file that exists under lib/html/ must be in exactly one of those
#     two sets, and every listed synced file must exist. Anything else is
#     RED.
#
# Callers: tools/sync-html-kernel.sh --check, and the html-kernel-
# differential job in CI (runs on every main-targeted
# PR, so a planted file cannot merge quietly once that job is a required
# check). Works on a plain tree (CI tarball extract has no .git):
# enumeration is filesystem-based, which also catches untracked planted
# files locally.
