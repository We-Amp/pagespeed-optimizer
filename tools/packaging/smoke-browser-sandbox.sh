#
# Legs (design doc §7.1):
#   1  --browser-sandbox rejects anything but require|off -- in particular
#      `auto`, the silently-degrading mode this gate exists to remove
#   2  probe available    -> browser_sandbox="on" on /v1/health
#   3  probe unavailable  -> the daemon STARTS and SERVES, logs one named
#      ERROR, reports browser_sandbox="unavailable", and spawns no Chrome
#   4  --browser-sandbox=off -> browser_sandbox="off", WARNING banner present
#   5  no `--no-sandbox` appears in any spawned argv unless mode is `off`
#   6  /v1/health and /v1/stats carry `syscall_filter`, and
#      under a real kernel syscall filter that denies unshare(2) the daemon
#      still serves and the refusal names SIGSYS and a remedy -- not the
#      "did not complete" that used to cover a timeout too.  The
#      none -> filtered transition is asserted only when this host starts
#      unfiltered; otherwise it says so instead of banking a vacuous check.
#      Same rule for an unanswered probe: on a host stalled past the
#      probe's bounded wait the cause-naming checks report INCONCLUSIVE
#      (and the final banner says the filter path went unverified) rather
#      than failing as if the daemon had named the wrong cause
#
# Leg 3 needs a process for which unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER) is unavailable.  The
# probe treats uid 0 as unavailable (Chrome refuses to sandbox as root), so a
# root run IS the negative leg -- which is also the posture the container
# images are in today.  A non-root run on a userns-capable kernel is the
# positive leg.  CI runs both because its images differ; each leg skips when
# the host cannot produce its precondition, and the run asserts that at least
# one of the two fired.
#
# Self-contained: a scratch directory, no systemd, no packaging, no Chrome.
