# Build the pagespeed-optimizer deb: the factory worker as a host package

# serving-module package can declare a hard versioned dependency on it.
#
#   build-optimizer-deb.sh --version VERSION [--binary PATH] [--out DIR]
#                          [--library PATH] [--expect-version STR]

#   build-optimizer-deb.sh --self-test
#
# The script does NOT run bazel: the binary is an input (default
# bazel-bin/src/worker/factory_worker), which keeps the packaging layout
# testable without a build (--self-test uses a stub) and keeps "which
# binary went in" an explicit, auditable choice of the caller.
#
# The serving module binds the daemon through the C API client library
# (dlopen of the bare soname libpagespeed.so, no path override), so the
# package ships it too: --library (default
# bazel-bin/lib/pagespeed/libpagespeed.so) lands in the multiarch libdir
# and the maintainer scripts run ldconfig. The glibc Depends floor is the
# max across BOTH ELF objects.
#
# The binary static-links its C++ runtime by design (see the cc_binary's
# linkopts), so the only runtime dependency is glibc. The Depends floor is
# DERIVED from the binary's GLIBC_* dynamic-symbol versions, never declared
# by hand; --glibc-floor exists only for non-ELF stand-ins (the self-test
# stub) and REFUSES to contradict a derivable floor. A GA lane should still
# consider dpkg-shlibdeps.
#
# --expect-version STR: when the binary executes on this host, its
# --version output must contain STR (typically the pinned source revision)
# or the build refuses. Passing it for a binary that cannot execute here is
# refused too: an unverifiable claim is not a tripwire.

Description: PageSpeed optimizer daemon
 The optimization daemon serving module integrations over a local socket:
 image/css/js optimization with quality verification, a shared cache
 volume, and a systemd-supervised service. Ships the daemon and the C API
 client library (libpagespeed.so) that serving modules bind. Serving-module
 packages depend on this package at an exact version; the two ship together.
