# Build the pagespeed-optimizer RPM: the factory worker as a host package
# (systemd-supervised, UDS socket, EnvironmentFile-tunable) plus the C API
# client library (libpagespeed.so) a serving module binds by soname —
# the RPM sibling of build-optimizer-deb.sh, so RPM-based serving-module
# packages can declare an exact-version Requires on it.
#
#   build-optimizer-rpm.sh --version VERSION [--binary PATH] [--out DIR]
#                          [--library PATH] [--expect-version STR]
#                          [--glibc-floor X.Y]
#   build-optimizer-rpm.sh --self-test
#
# The script does NOT run bazel: the binary and library are inputs
# (defaults: bazel-bin/src/worker/factory_worker and
# bazel-bin/lib/pagespeed/libpagespeed.so). It DOES require rpmbuild —
# absent rpmbuild it refuses with a container hint (the CI lane runs it
# in an EL image; local runs can too).
#
# Version mapping: pass the PACKAGE version (tilde pre-release form,
# e.g. 1.16.0~rc.1). rpm's tilde sorts before the final release, the
# same ordering contract the deb carries. The string maps to the spec as
# Version: <part before first '-'> / Release: <part after, or 1> — this
# package's train versions never carry '-', so Release is always 1.
#
# The glibc Requires floor is DERIVED as the max across both ELF objects'
# GLIBC_* dynamic symbols and expressed as an explicit
# "Requires: glibc >= X.Y" (rpmbuild's automatic ELF find-requires adds
# the per-symbol-version requires as well; the explicit floor keeps the
# human-auditable contract identical to the deb). --glibc-floor exists
# only for non-ELF stand-ins (the self-test stubs) and refuses to
# contradict a derivable floor.
#
# --expect-version STR: when the binary executes on this host, its
# --version output must contain STR or the build refuses; passing it for
# a binary that cannot execute here is refused too.

# No BuildRequires on systemd-rpm-macros: rpmbuild ENFORCES build deps against
# the rpmdb, and the packaging image is a Debian-family host whose rpmdb knows
# no EL package at all -- the requirement could never be satisfied there, only
# refused. The spec below needs no macro package: it uses the EL sysusers
# macros where they are defined and spells out the same result where they are
# not.
Requires: glibc >= $glibc_floor
# Browser analysis is optional and the package ships no browser. A weak
# dependency: EL9's rpm honours it, and the pinned build container's rpmbuild
# parses the tag (an rpm too old to know it would refuse the spec, not skip
# the line -- moot here, stated so nobody relies on the opposite).
Suggests: chromium
# useradd/groupadd in %pre (sysusers compat expansion) need shadow-utils.
# Stated OUTRIGHT as well as through the macro: rpm on a Debian-family host
# ships no EL macro set at all, so an unconditional %%sysusers_requires_compat
# is an Unknown tag there and the spec never parses. rpm folds the duplicate
# away where both apply, so the dependency is declared exactly once either way.

%description
The optimization daemon serving module integrations over a local socket:
image/css/js optimization with quality verification, a shared cache
volume, and a systemd-supervised service. Ships the daemon and the C API
client library (libpagespeed.so) that serving modules bind. Serving-module
packages depend on this package at an exact version; the two ship together.
