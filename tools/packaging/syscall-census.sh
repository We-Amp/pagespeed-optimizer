#   syscall-census.sh --in-container --binary PATH --library PATH --work DIR
#
# This is the MEASURE half of "measure, then filter".  It is deliberately a
# manual/periodic lane, not a per-PR gate: it needs strace (so, a container
# with CAP_SYS_PTRACE and no seccomp confinement of its own), it is slow, and
# its output is an INPUT to a human decision -- which systemd syscall groups
# the shipped unit names -- not an assertion.  The per-PR assertions live in
# verify-daemon-systemd.sh, which checks the CONSEQUENCE of that decision.
#
# What it produces, per distro:
#
#   census-<distro>.txt      every syscall name observed, per posture
#   census-<distro>.md       the same intersected with this distro's systemd
#                            @system-service group, split into
#                            "already admitted" / "NOT in @system-service"
#
# The second list is the only one that matters: a name in it is a call the
# shipped allow-list would kill, so it must either be explained (it belongs
# to a posture the base profile does not support -- browser analysis) or
# admitted by name.  An EMPTY second list is the result that lets
# `SystemCallFilter=@system-service` ship as-is.
#
# Why names and never numbers: syscall numbering differs per architecture
# (aarch64 has no open/stat/fork/select; x86_64 has no *_time64 forms), and
# systemd owns the name -> number mapping per arch.  The census output is a
# NAME list, intersected with a systemd GROUP, so the arch matrix stays
# systemd's problem and not ours (design §5.1).
#
# Postures (brief §2.2).  P1-P3 and P7 are measured here; P4-P6 are recorded
# as NOT MEASURED with the reason, because the rig image carries no Chrome:
#
#   P1  cold start, cache create+open, three UDS binds, a peer cache open
#       through the shipped client library, SIGTERM shutdown.  API off.
#   P2  P1 + --api-socket           (H5's default transport; AF_UNIX)
#   P3  P1 + --api-port + token     (the TCP posture; AF_INET)
#   P7  P1 + SIGHUP (the reload signal; ignored by design since #1465) before
#       the SIGTERM
#   P4  browser analysis + Chrome     NOT MEASURED (no Chrome in the rig image)
#   P5  agent_optimize curl child     curl measured STANDALONE (see below)
#   P6  license renewal curl child    same child, same set; RC-window only
#
# P5/P6 share one measurable fact -- the syscall set of a curl(1) child that
# inherits the parent's filter -- so the census straces a real curl fetch
# rather than pretending the daemon-side trigger is reachable here.  That is
# the honest half: it is why AF_INET/AF_INET6 stay in the base
# RestrictAddressFamilies= (§2.4), and it is recorded as such.
