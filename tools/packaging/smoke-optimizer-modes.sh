# Local smoke test for the daemon permission model:
# run factory_worker NON-root against a scratch cache dir and assert every
# mode the design pins, plus the loud refusal-to-start legs.
#
#   smoke-optimizer-modes.sh [--binary PATH]
#
# Asserts (design doc §4 table):
#   notify/health/mgmt sockets  0660
#   volume file(s)              0660
#   pagespeed-shared.conf       0640, and carries cache_dir_generation=1
#   .pagespeed-serve-stats      0660
#   no world-writable bit anywhere under the cache or socket dirs
#   missing cache dir           -> refuses to start, log names "does not exist"
#   unwritable cache dir        -> refuses, log says "permission denied"
#   foreign-owned VOLUME file   -> refuses, log says "cannot own" (root only)
#   foreign-owned bystander     -> starts anyway: the cache dir is
#                                  group-writable by design, so only the
#                                  daemon's OWN files carry the ownership
#                                  rule (root only)
#
# POSIX-only (modes are a POSIX concept here). Cheap and local: no
# systemd, no packaging, no web server. The full multi-distro install
# rig (design §9) is a follow-up arc; this catches mode regressions in
# every local/CI run.
