# Package-install verification, booted-systemd half (design §9, legs 1 and
# 5): the unit as systemd actually runs it, and the restart-backoff
# latch.  Runs INSIDE a container whose PID 1 is systemd; the host-side driver
# (daemon-install-rig.sh) starts that container and falls back to a documented
# skip when the runner cannot host one.
#
#   verify-daemon-systemd.sh --package PATH [--work DIR]
#
# Nothing here is emulated: the maintainer scripts take their systemd branch,
# systemd-sysusers/systemd-tmpfiles run as the package intends, User=/Group=/
# CapabilityBoundingSet=/RuntimeDirectory= are applied by systemd, and the
# assertions read systemd's own view of the service.
#
# The backoff leg is the one that cannot be observed any other way.  A
# PERMANENT refusal to start (§6 degrade rules: cache directory missing,
# unwritable, or holding foreign-owned daemon files) must LATCH `failed` so an
# operator and monitoring see it -- not restart every RestartSec forever.  That
# depends on StartLimitIntervalSec=/StartLimitBurst= sitting in [Unit], where
# systemd honours them; in [Service] systemd ignores them with a warning and
# the daemon would loop.  The deb/rpm self-tests already assert the DIRECTIVES
# are in [Unit]; this asserts the resulting BEHAVIOUR.

# ------------------------------------------------ leg: a real headless Chrome ----

# (require -- never off):
#
#   1. the shipped default -- the enforcing unit + the vendor browser
#      profile, nothing under /etc: Chrome starts sandboxed, renders pages
#      across a service restart, and keeps running -- so the browser
#      profile's re-admission list is proven SUFFICIENT, not just necessary.
#      This is the half a log-only soak cannot see (the @resources and
#      @privileged subtractions are inside @system-service and are never
#      logged), and it is the half that goes red first if a hardening
#      directive or a Chrome release breaks the sandbox.
#   2. the documented opt-out (log-only), browser profile still present: the
#      same cycle.  The negative control for half 1 -- a Chrome that dies

# ------------------------------------------------ leg: the long-idle soak ----
# Issue #1485.  h6-browser-analysis watches Chrome for ~40 s; the failure it
# could not catch (the 1.16.0-rc.11 flake, fixed in #1483) was a syscall
# with a MINUTES-SCALE period: Chromium's MemoryInfra thread calls
# mincore(2) in a burst every ~3-4 min, so a name missing from the browser
# drop-in kills Chrome only when a burst happens to land inside the window
# (~15-25% per run).  No assertion cadence fixes that; only a window longer
# than the period does.  This leg keeps a real sandboxed Chrome up under the
# enforcing unit + browser profile, IDLE -- the bursts fire without any
# render traffic; the #1483 A/B reproduced two kills 4m25s apart on an idle
# browser -- and asserts zero kills over the window.
#
# The window is H6_SOAK_SECONDS, deliberately defaulting to 0 (SKIP): two
# observed burst periods are ~8 minutes, a periodic-cadence window, not a
# per-PR one.  CI Periodic's daemon-rig-soak-x64 job runs this rig with
# H6_SOAK_SECONDS=570; the per-PR Daemon Privilege Rig matrix records the
# SKIP below, so the gap shows in every summary instead of vanishing.
