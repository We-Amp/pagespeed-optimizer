# sync-html-kernel.sh - Vendor the canonical HTML kernel from mod_pagespeed 1.15.
#
# ModPageSpeed 2.0 does NOT own its HTML lexer/parser kernel. Since #1130
# (cloning the JS-kernel machinery) the 1.15 repository
# (mod_pagespeed) is the single canonical source: fixes land there
# first and flow here through this script. The vendored copy under lib/html/
# is CHECKED IN so the 2.0 build stays hermetic, and
# a CI drift check re-runs this script against
# the pin and fails if the checked-in files would change — a hand-edit of a
# vendored file, or a pin bump without a re-sync, can never drift silently.
# Hand edits to vendored files are NEVER sanctioned; fix the canonical source
# and re-sync.
#
# The pin lives in lib/html/HTML_KERNEL_PIN (first token of the first
# non-comment line = the canonical 1.15 commit SHA). Bump the pin, re-run
# this script, and commit the result together.
#
# Pin-downgrade ratchet (D1 #1104, cloned): the same file records a
# forward-only floor on a second line, `floor <sha>`. The ancestry gate below
# alone would accept ANY ancestor of canonical master, so re-pinning to an
# older-but-complete commit yields a self-consistent tree that passes both
# the drift and the differential gates. The floor closes that window: this
# script fails (exit 6) unless the pin equals the floor or has it as an
# ancestor. Convention: a routine pin bump moves the floor to the new pin in
# the same commit; a hotfix-valve pin (unmerged branch, see below) keeps the
# floor at the last MERGED pin and moves it at reconciliation.
# tools/ci/check-floor-ratchet.sh additionally enforces that the floor
# itself never moves backwards relative to origin/main — as a REQUIRED check
# in ci.yml's html-kernel-differential job and as the advisory RATCHET step
# in the drift workflow.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/sync-html-kernel.sh --source <path-to-1.15-git-checkout-or-mirror>
#   tools/sync-html-kernel.sh --source <path> --check   # drift check (no writes)
#
# --source may be any local git dir (worktree, clone, bare mirror) in which
# the pinned commit is reachable; only `git show` is used, never the working
# tree. --check regenerates into a temp dir and byte-compares against the
# committed tree: exit 0 = in sync, exit 1 = drift (offending files listed).
# Every sync also (re)writes lib/html/SYNCED_FILES.txt — the explicit ledger
# of the synced set that tools/check-html-kernel-membership.sh enforces
# tree-locally (also invoked by --check).
#
# Pin-ancestry valve: by default the pinned commit must be an ancestor of the
# source's master (origin/master if present, else master) — a merged,
# permanent commit. SYNC_ALLOW_UNMERGED_PIN=1 permits a pin on a pushed but
# unmerged 1.15 branch (hotfix flow). Because 1.15 PRs are usually
# squash-merged, the unmerged pin's SHA will NOT survive the merge:
# reconciliation is ALWAYS re-pin to the squashed master commit followed by
# an expected no-op re-sync. The drift workflow honors the valve only on
# pull_request events, so the hotfix PR can go green while push/schedule
# runs stay red until the pin is reconciled.
#
# Transform (deterministic):
#   * anchored ^#include rewrites per the fixed mapping table below
#     (pagespeed/kernel/html -> lib/html, http/content_type.h -> lib/html,
#     google_url + message_handler family -> lib/html/compat/, other
#     kernel/base headers -> lib/html/compat/ or lib/base/);
#   * NO source-code rewrites beyond the include lines. The canonical kernel
#     no longer uses the StringPiece::CopyToString member call (retired
#     canonical-side, mpp #671), so the vendored files compile against the
#     2.0 compat StringPiece — a TRUE alias of std::string_view, which cannot
#     supply that member. A residue check below fails the sync loudly if the
#     canonical source ever reintroduces the call.
#   * a provenance banner is prepended; the original license header of each
#     canonical file is retained byte-for-byte below it (the vendored kernel
#     files carry their Apache-2.0 header — see lib/html/LICENSE.apache-2.0).
#
# Scope note: html_parse_probe.cc and html_parse_recorder.h ride the pin
# (D1 probe precedent: the D2 differential goldens gate both repos' probes).
# They were briefly held out of the synced set because canonical
# html_parse_recorder.h used the StringPiece member AppendToString — absent
# from the 2.0 compat's TRUE std::string_view alias; mpp #675 reconciled
# that canonical-side (append(data(), size())), so they joined the set.
# The residue check below still greps AppendToString so a reintroduction
# anywhere in the synced set fails loudly. The parse corpus itself
# (tools/html-parse-corpus/) is vendored separately and byte-aligned; it is
# NOT part of this sync. optimizer-owned lib/html files
# (subresource_collector_filter, sitemap_parser, markdown_extractor_filter,
# robots_ai_directives, llms_txt_formatter, html_metadata_extractor,
# safe_entity_decode, csp_inline_policy, html_fuzz) stay 2.0-owned and are
# never touched by this script; tools/check-html-kernel-membership.sh
# enumerates them explicitly.

# the CURRENT vendored names plus FORMERLY_VENDORED (files un-vendored by a
# scope change — their removal from trees synced by an older tool is exactly
# how scope shrinks propagate; drop entries once no supported tree's ledger
# can contain them). This matches D1's safety level (its rm set is
# hardcoded) by keeping every rm target inside an explicit name set in this
