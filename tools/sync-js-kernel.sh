# sync-js-kernel.sh - Vendor the canonical JS kernel from mod_pagespeed 1.15.
#
# mod_pagespeed 2.1 does NOT own its JavaScript tokenizer/minifier kernel.
# The 1.15 repository (mod_pagespeed) is the single
# canonical source: fixes land there first and flow here through this script.
# The vendored copy under lib/js/ is CHECKED IN so the 2.0 build stays
# hermetic, and a CI drift check re-runs this
# script against the pin and fails if the checked-in files would change — a
# hand-edit of a vendored file, or a pin bump without a re-sync, can never
# drift silently. Hand edits to vendored files are NEVER sanctioned; fix the
# canonical source and re-sync.
#
# The pin lives in lib/js/JS_KERNEL_PIN (first token of the first
# non-comment line = the canonical 1.15 commit SHA). Bump the pin, re-run
# this script, and commit the result together.
#
# Pin-downgrade ratchet (#1104): the same file records a forward-only floor
# on a second line, `floor <sha>`. The ancestry gate below alone would
# accept ANY ancestor of canonical master, so re-pinning to an
# older-but-complete commit yields a self-consistent tree that passes both
# the drift and the differential gates. The floor closes that window: this
# script fails (exit 6) unless the pin equals the floor or has it as an
# ancestor. Convention: a routine pin bump moves the floor to the new pin
# in the same commit; a hotfix-valve pin (unmerged branch, see below)
# keeps the floor at the last MERGED pin and moves it at reconciliation.
# tools/ci/check-floor-ratchet.sh additionally enforces that the floor
# itself never moves backwards relative to origin/main — as a REQUIRED
# check in ci.yml's js-kernel-differential job and as the advisory RATCHET
# step in the drift workflow.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/sync-js-kernel.sh --source <path-to-1.15-git-checkout-or-mirror>
#   tools/sync-js-kernel.sh --source <path> --check   # drift check (no writes)
#
# --source may be any local git dir (worktree, clone, bare mirror) in which
# the pinned commit is reachable; only `git show` is used, never the working
# tree. --check regenerates into a temp dir and byte-compares against the
# committed tree: exit 0 = in sync, exit 1 = drift (offending files listed).
# Every sync also (re)writes lib/js/SYNCED_FILES.txt — the explicit ledger
# of the synced set that tools/check-js-kernel-membership.sh enforces
# tree-locally (also invoked by --check).
#
# Pin-ancestry valve: by default the pinned commit must be an ancestor of the
# source's master (origin/master if present, else master) — a merged,
# permanent commit. SYNC_ALLOW_UNMERGED_PIN=1 permits a pin on a pushed but
# unmerged 1.15 branch (hotfix flow). Because 1.15 PRs are usually
# squash-merged, the unmerged pin's SHA will NOT survive the merge:
# reconciliation is ALWAYS re-pin to the squashed master commit followed by
# an expected no-op re-sync. The drift workflow honors the valve only on
# pull_request events, so the hotfix PR can go green while push/schedule
# runs stay red until the pin is reconciled.
#
# Transform (deterministic):
#   * anchored ^#include rewrites per the fixed mapping table below
#     (pagespeed/kernel/js -> lib/js, base/util headers -> lib/js/compat/);
#   * NO source-code rewrites beyond the include lines. The canonical
#     kernel no longer uses the StringPiece::AppendToString member call
#     (retired canonical-side), so the vendored files compile against the
#     2.0 compat StringPiece — a TRUE alias of std::string_view, which
#     cannot supply that member. A residue check below fails the sync
#     loudly if the canonical source ever reintroduces the call.
#   * a provenance banner is prepended; the original license header of each
#     canonical file is retained byte-for-byte below it (the vendored kernel
#     files carry their Apache-2.0 header — see lib/js/LICENSE.apache-2.0).
# Corpus files (gen_goldens.py, generate_synthetic.py, goldens manifest,
# checked-in corpus inputs) are copied VERBATIM: the goldens manifest pins
# the generators' sha256 and every input's sha256, so any transformation
# would break the shared expectation that gates both repos.
#
# NOTE for source_map.h: vendored HEADER-ONLY by design. source_map.cc
# (Encode and friends) drags a jsoncpp dependency and has zero 2.0 callers;
# net_instaweb::source_map::Encode stays declared-but-undefined here, and a
# link error on first use is the documentation of that decision.
