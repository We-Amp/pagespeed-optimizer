"""Proactive multi-variant generation stress tests.

Tests the worker's ability to handle concurrent proactive variant generation
(multiple formats x viewports x densities x save-data from a single decode),
including large images and sustained throughput.

Note: Notifications are sent by nginx on cache MISS, not manually.
Nginx's r->uri excludes query strings, so the cache key is just the path.
