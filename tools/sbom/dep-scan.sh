# Comprehensive, report-only dependency CVE scan — phase 1.
#
# Generates SBOMs from DETERMINISTIC, COMMITTED inputs and scans them with grype:
#   - npm    : EVERY committed npm lockfile in the tree, in both lockfile
#              dialects (pnpm-lock.yaml / package-lock.json). The
#              surface list (NPM_LOCKFILES) is COVERAGE-CHECKED against
#              `git ls-files` (see assert_npm_coverage): a committed lockfile
#              that is not registered is a loud failure, not a silent hole.
#   - cargo  : lib/image/vtracer_ffi/Cargo.lock (committed; the Bazel build
#              consumes it via crate_universe from_cargo, so build == scan)
#   - images : (only with --images) the BUILT product images the build machine
#              produces — modpagespeed/worker, modpagespeed/nginx,
#              pagespeed2-base-runtime, pagespeed2-dev — scanned from the local
#              docker cache. This is the OS / apt / Chromium / .so layer grype
#              matches reliably; the part of the C/C++ surface syft-on-source
#              cannot see.
#
# Determinism: every source ecosystem is scanned from a COMMITTED lockfile,
# copied into an isolated temp dir so syft sees ONLY that file. We never
# `syft dir:.` a project tree (that pulls in whatever node_modules / obj / bin
# happen to be present; a .NET project dir was observed cataloging 744 npm
# pkgs) and we never generate a lockfile at scan time (a generated lockfile can
# resolve differently than what the product build pins — the exact drift this
# is meant to kill). Images are scanned by the build machine where they exist.
#
# DEV DEPENDENCIES ARE IN SCOPE (SYFT_JAVASCRIPT_INCLUDE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES below).
# syft's package-lock.json cataloger SKIPS `"dev": true` entries by default, so
# a package-lock.json that is (nearly) all devDependencies catalogues almost
# nothing and reports a false 0/0/0/0 — a gate that reports "clean" over
# packages it never examined is worse than no gate. Dev deps are therefore
# included everywhere; the empty-catalog guard in run_scan turns any surface
# that still catalogues 0 packages into a scan failure rather than a clean row.
# (pnpm-lock.yaml is unaffected — syft's pnpm cataloger already reports the full
# `packages:` section.)
#
# NOT covered here (tracked in the README): .NET (its real surface is the
# built .nupkg, not a dev-restore — deferred to a post-build scan); transitive
# vendored C/C++ Bazel deps (Envoy CPE+NVD model, lands in mod_pagespeed).
#
# Two modes:
#   REPORT-ONLY (default): prints a per-source severity histogram, writes SBOMs
#     + grype reports under $OUT_DIR, and ALWAYS exits 0. This is the daily /
#     scheduled posture — surfaces newly-disclosed CVEs without ever reddening CI.
#   BLOCKING (--fail-on <sev>): same scan, exits NON-ZERO on gate hits (after
#     VEX suppression). Gate shape differs by surface (see run_scan):
#     npm/cargo gate UNCONDITIONALLY at <sev>+; images gate at <sev>+ when a
#     fix is available (fix.state "fixed") and at High/Critical always.
#     Used by the per-PR + push gate (npm + cargo, clean at medium+ today)
#     and the scheduled image gate. Restrict the scanned set with --surfaces
#     to keep the still-report-only surfaces (.NET) out of the gate.
#     See tools/sbom/README.md.
#
# syft + grype must be on PATH at the pinned versions below. On the blocking
# path the grype DB is pinned (GRYPE_DB_AUTO_UPDATE=false + a provisioned
# dated archive — see the CI dependency gate + tools/sbom/grype-db-pin.json)
# so a newly-published CVE cannot non-deterministically break an in-flight PR.

  #
  #   image : MEDIUM band gates only when ACTIONABLE (fix.state == "fixed" —
  #     a rebuild's dist-upgrade or a base bump resolves it), because the
  #     shipped images' OS population carries a permanent wont-fix/not-fixed
  #     medium tail (post-remediation 2026-06-11: 100% of the SHIPPED images'
  #     remaining mediums) and "suppressing" it with unprovable not_affected
  #     VEX claims would be dishonest (the analysis Chromium genuinely links
  #     the codec libs, and it runs --no-sandbox). HIGH/CRITICAL always gate,
  #     fixable or not — a Critical in a shipped image never rides silently;
  #     the out is an evidence-backed VEX statement or structural removal
  #     (like the 2026-06-11 nginx re-base), not a filter.
