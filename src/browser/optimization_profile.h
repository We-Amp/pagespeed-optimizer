// The argument MUST be the bytes produced by `Worker::BuildCombinedCss`
// (src/worker/worker.h), and a producer of a validation record MUST CALL that
// function rather than reconstruct the bytes. A record is only meaningful
// against the exact sequence the serve path will hash, and the assembly has
// enough steps that an independent reimplementation will drift:
//
//   1. Seed: `scan_result.inline_css` verbatim — the concatenated <style>
//      bodies, exactly as HtmlScanner produced them. Since the
//      stylesheet-source rule that
//      leaves out <style> inside <noscript>, <template>, <noembed>, <noframes>
//      and <math> (and step 3 the links there), so a record made before it
//      for a page with such CSS no longer matches and must be re-validated.
//   2. @import flattening of that seed (relative URLs against the document's
//      base URL, i.e. the page URL or its <base href>, since the block-first
//      placement) is
//      ALL-OR-NOTHING: the flattened result
//      replaces the seed only when `imports_resolved > 0`; any unresolved
//      import leaves the ORIGINAL bytes. Disabled entirely under
//      `disable_css_import_flattening`.
//   3. Then each declared external <link rel=stylesheet>, in the order
//      HtmlScanner recorded them (document order), its href resolved against
//      the document's base URL (the page URL or its <base href>; under a
//      cross-host <base> a root-relative href is the base host's sheet)
//      and read from cache at the normalized URL, keyed by that
//      host. Hrefless sheets are skipped; a sheet that resolves with an EMPTY
//      body contributes nothing and does not set the missing flag.
//   4. Join: a single "\n" before each appended sheet, and only when the
//      accumulator is already non-empty. No trailing newline, no separator
//      before the first contribution.
//   5. Per-sheet @import flattening is all-or-nothing on the same rule.
//   6. Cap: 10 MiB. Exceeding it BREAKS out of the loop — later sheets are
//      silently absent from the bytes and `external_css_missing` is set.
//   7. No normalization of any kind: no minification, no whitespace collapsing,
//      no ordering fix-up. Bytes in, bytes hashed.
//
// KNOWN INSTABILITIES — accepted, and design inputs for the validator that
// will produce these records:
//   * A sheet whose cache entry flips between original and minified variants
//     changes these bytes without the stylesheet having been republished. The
//     record invalidates and the page reverts to render-blocking until it is
//     re-validated. Correct direction (fail toward render-blocking), but it
//     means "hash changed" does NOT imply "the site published new CSS".
//   * A transient cache miss on one sheet is indistinguishable here from a
//     redeploy: both simply produce different bytes. The validator must not
//     treat a single mismatch as evidence the site changed.

// As above, bound to the page's cascade-layer order as well:
// `layer_order_binding` is CascadeLayerOrder::ValidationBinding(css)

// and, if so, the `@layer` statement put in front of a layered critical block;
// it is empty for a sheet that uses no cascade layer, so those records still
// hash the sheet alone.
// That decides where the block goes and what both validation documents carry,
// yet it is NOT in the combined sheet's bytes: a layer() / supports() @import
// is never flattened into them, but the order reads its sheet from cache. An
// import cached at analysis time and not at serve time (or the reverse, or
// changed in between) flips the placement while the sheet hash still matches,
// so the record binds to both. An empty binding hashes the sheet alone, as the
// one-argument form does. Empty `css` still hashes to "".

// The binding a validation record is made and checked under:
// `layer_order_binding` as above, salted when the page's <noscript> content
// changes what a render with script execution disabled shows
// (HtmlScanResult::noscript_affects_render). The analysis renders render such
// a page without that content now, so a record made while they rendered it is
// about another fold: the salt makes it mismatch, and the page is validated
// again once (BrowserAnalysisManager::RequestRevalidation). Pages without
// such content, the GTM snippet's hidden iframe or a tracking pixel included,
// keep their records. Both sides pass the result as `layer_order_binding`.
//
// Also salted when `combined_css` escapes a quote, a brace or a
// comma outside a string (CombinedCssHasStructuralEscape): until that was fixed
// the extractor misread such a sheet (an escaped quote opened a string that
// never closed, an escaped brace nested, an escaped comma split a selector),
// so the blocks validated for it lost most of their fold rules and its
// records are mostly negative. The salt makes them mismatch once, so the page
// is validated again with blocks derived from the whole sheet instead of
// staying render-blocking until the profile expires. Other sheets keep their
// records.
//
// And salted for the tablet viewport's records (`viewport` is
// kTablet): before that the tablet viewport was analysed and validated
// as a desktop window, so its blocks and verdicts are about a layout tablet
// visitors do not get. Every tablet record mismatches once and the analysed
// page is validated again, through the same rate-limited path. Mobile and
// desktop records keep theirs.
//
// And salted for the mobile and tablet viewports' records
// ("touch"): before touch emulation their renders emulated no touch screen, so
// `(hover: hover)` / `(pointer: fine)` rules applied in the coverage and
// validation renders and `(hover: none)` / `(pointer: coarse)` rules did not,
// the reverse of a phone visitor's browser, and the extractor now reads those
// features for the two classes (RetentionPointer). Every mobile and tablet
// record mismatches once; desktop records keep theirs.
//
// And salted for the mobile and tablet viewports' records
// ("ua"): before User-Agent emulation their renders reported the browser's
// desktop user agent, and the renders that write the document with
// Page.setDocumentContent wrote it into a window that predates the
// emulation (`'ontouchstart' in window` false). Since then they report a
// phone's or a tablet's UA (EmulateDevice) and write the document into a
// fresh window (LoadFreshBlankDocument). Every mobile and tablet record
// mismatches once, so the page is validated again by renders that are the
// device in those respects as well; desktop records keep theirs (the desktop
// window is sent no UA override).
//
// Also salted when the derivation of the block being served or
// validated left every anonymous-layer rule out of it
// (`anonymous_layers_dropped`, CriticalCssResult::anonymous_layers_dropped of
// the same DeriveDomMatchedCriticalCss / Extract call on both sides). The
// layer binding's `u2` marker says the same from the combined sheet alone;
// this salt comes from the derivation itself, so it also covers a block that
// only the extractor's check on the finished block moved after the sheets,
// which the sheet-keyed marker cannot see. Both sides pass the flag of their
// own derivation, made the same way from the same sheet and order. That
// finished-block check is the flag's one element-dependent leg: on a page
// whose markup differs between the analysis render and a later serve, with a
// proven order, an anonymous layer and a trailing `@import ... layer()`, the
// flag can differ between the two and the record mismatch, which takes the
// rate-limited revalidation path like any other mismatch.
