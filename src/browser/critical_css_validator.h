// PageSpeed 2.0 — Critical-CSS validator
//
// Answers, empirically, the one question the async-CSS byte-ratio floor can
// only guess at: does the page's fold look the same when ONLY the inlined
// above-the-fold block is applied, as it does with the whole stylesheet?
//
// It builds two documents from the same page markup — one carrying the full
// combined stylesheet, one carrying the candidate critical block, and NOTHING
// else different — renders both, and diffs the fold. A positive answer is what
// the serve path's deferral gate requires (ViewportProfile::
// critical_css_validated); the absence of one means "keep the stylesheet
// render-blocking".
//
// FAIL-CLOSED IS THE WHOLE POINT. Every path that cannot produce a measurement
// — no browser, a refused injection, a screenshot that never arrived, a
// document too large to render, a comparison that compared no pixels — is "not
// validated", never "probably fine". A validator that guesses is worse than no
// validator, because the gate above it stops asking.
//
// THREE PERMANENT BLIND SPOTS. The first two are properties of the render's
// SSRF defense (src/browser/visual_regression_gate.cc) and therefore not
// tunable; the third is a property of what a record is attached to:
//   1. Scripts do not run. A fold whose layout is established by JavaScript is
//      validated against a DOM the visitor never sees.
//   2. Every subresource fails. Images, web fonts and @import-ed sheets load in
//      NEITHER document, so a fold that depends on a dropped background-image
//      or @font-face renders identically blank in both and diffs to zero.
//   3. Confirmation is per TEMPLATE, not per page. The record hangs off the
//      profile, and the profile is keyed on a tag-tree hash that ignores
//      classes and ids — so page B, which shares A's template, defers on A's
//      record even though B's critical block is re-derived against B's own DOM
//      and may drop a rule B's fold needs. Deliberate: hashing per page would
//      invalidate nearly everything and the feature would never apply. The
//      exposure is real and bounded by how alike a template's pages are.
// The rendered probe lane (tools/async-css-probe) is the only instrument that
// covers the second class; nothing in-product can. Nothing covers the third —
// an operator who sees a fold problem on one page of a template should turn
// deferral off for the site (--no-async-css) rather than expect the gate to
// have caught it.
//
// WHICH PAGES REACH THIS AT ALL. Deferral is only inlined-and-deferred below
// the inline budget (browser_internal::kInlineCriticalCssMaxCoverage, 0.60), so
// a page whose critical block covers more of its sheet than that is suppressed
// before validation and never validated — by design, since there is no
// deferral to authorize. The measured fixture below sits at 0.83 and is one of
// them: its numbers exercise the mechanism, not a page production would
// confirm.
//
// CASCADE ORDER. The synthesized documents move the page's own <style> bodies
// into the single injected block, which is later in document order than they
// were. Two rules of equal specificity can therefore resolve differently here
// than in the served page, where the inlined block sits in <head> and the
// deferred sheet applies afterwards. The direction is conservative — a
// difference this introduces shows up as a diff and refuses — but it is a
// reason a page can fail to be confirmed that has nothing to do with its fold.

// extractor really produces and against the same block with its layout
// DECLARATIONS stripped out (the pre-fix extraction shape that caused the

// rasterization noise, not a difference anyone can see, but noise a threshold
// has to sit above, and intermittent enough that a single run will not show
// it. That leaves 0.005 with ~12x margin over observed noise and 0.002 with
// ~5x. Nothing measured here argues for the tighter value, and the looser one
// is what a noisy render is least likely to trip. It stays at 0.005 until the
