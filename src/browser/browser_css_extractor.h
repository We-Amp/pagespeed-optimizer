// Parses a critical-CSS blob into the set of rule identities it contains
// (selector identities only). The DOM-matched critical-CSS producer consumes
// this as a `force_include` augmentation so rules a static, JS-off, light-mode
// sample cannot match — but that Chrome DID exercise at first paint — are still
// retained.
//
// The input is raw byte slices reconstructed from Chrome CSS coverage ranges,
// so it may be brace-unbalanced and structurally partial. This parser is
// deliberately defensive: it never crashes, never hangs, and skips CSS strings
// and comments so braces in `content:"{"` or comments do not corrupt nesting.
// It tracks enclosing @layer/@media context best-effort — and usually there is
// none to track, because a coverage range covers the rule and never the
// `@layer ... {` / `@media ... {` prelude enclosing it, so most identities come
// out context-free. That is not inert: the producer relaxes both context fields
// on a primary-key miss, matching a context-free identity against the single
// (layer, media) context the sheet places that selector in, and against nothing
// at all when the sheet is ambiguous about it. This remains intentionally
// lossy; the DOM-matched producer is the primary fix and does not depend on
// this succeeding.

// The production derivation of the above-the-fold block a page is served: match
// the full combined stylesheet against THIS page's DOM, using the browser
// profile's observed coverage as the force-include augmentation for the
// matcher's blind spots.
//
// ONE implementation, deliberately. The serve path calls it to produce the
// block it inlines, and the validation that authorizes deferring calls it to
// produce the block it renders. A second derivation would mean the record says
// "this block covers the fold" about a block the visitor never receives — a
// validation that is worse than none, because the gate above it stops asking.
//
// `profile_critical_css` is the raw browser-coverage blob; an empty one simply
// means no force-include augmentation.
//
// `measured_above_fold_selectors` is the viewport profile's measured fold
// (ViewportProfile::above_fold_selectors). It has NO default: which fold a
// derivation was made against is exactly the thing that must not be decided by
// omission, because a caller that quietly derives against a different fold from
// the serve path produces a block about bytes no visitor receives — and when
// that caller is the deferral validation, the result is a confirmation of a
// block nobody is served. Pass `{}` to mean "no measurement", explicitly.
