# Factory Worker

Lightweight C++ daemon handling optimization notifications from nginx.

## IPC Protocol

Non-blocking fire-and-forget. Nginx creates a Unix socket per
notification (O_NONBLOCK + poll 50ms), sends message, closes. Default: no
retries (prevents blocking nginx event loop). Optional retry with exponential
backoff (configurable via `RetryConfig`). Timeouts not retried.

**Wire format**: `[4B length][4B url_len][url][4B host_len][hostname][1B content_type][4B mask]`

If all retries exhausted, cache serves original. Subsequent requests re-notify
(natural retry via fallback-hit path).

## Shared Config File

The worker writes `pagespeed-shared.conf` on startup and on `PATCH /v1/config`
changes. Location: `parent_path(cache_path) / "pagespeed-shared.conf"`.

**Format:** `key=value` (one per line)

**Fields:**
- `socket_path` — Unix socket path for nginx notifications
- `disable_html` — Whether HTML optimization is disabled (`true`/`false`)

Since 2.1 there is no license state anywhere in the daemon: no
`license_key` / `license_valid` / `license_checked_once` in this file, no
`pagespeed.license` or `pagespeed.instance-id` sidecar, no `/v1/license/*`
routes, no `license` object in `/v1/health`, no `x-pagespeed-warn` header. The
`agent_optimize_entitled` key is still written but simply mirrors the operator
`--agent-optimize` flag. `--license-key` / `--license-renewal-url` (and the
`PAGESPEED_LICENSE_*` env vars / `pagespeed.json` keys) are accepted, ignored,
and answered with a one-time deprecation warning so 2.0 configs still start.

Nginx reads this file automatically (polled every ~1s) using `pagespeed_cache_path`
to locate the parent directory. This replaces the former `pagespeed_worker_socket`
and `pagespeed_critical_css` nginx directives.

## Production Hardening

- Max connections: 128 (`--max-connections`)
- Buffer cap: 1MB (`--max-buffer-size`)
- Connection timeout: 30s (`--connection-timeout`)
- Graceful shutdown: drains with 5s timeout (`--shutdown-timeout`)
- Health check: `{socket_path}.health` → `OK {active}/{max} notifs=N variants=N ...`

## HTTP Management API

Embedded HTTP/1.1 server (libuv + llhttp) for the web console and programmatic access.

**Files**: `http_server.h/.cc`, `api_handlers.cc`, `cache_handlers.cc`,
`capture_handlers.cc`, `websocket.h/.cc`,
`ws_handlers.cc`, `static_file_handler.cc`

**CLI flags**: `--api-port PORT` (default: 0=disabled), `--api-token TOKEN`
(or `PAGESPEED_API_TOKEN` env var), `--api-read-open` (or `PAGESPEED_API_READ_OPEN=true`),
`--console-dir PATH`

**Auth**: Bearer token via `--api-token` flag or `PAGESPEED_API_TOKEN` env var.
Health and the `/console`/`/console/*` static bundle
(GET/HEAD only — static assets carry no data, #1449) are always exempt.
`--api-read-open` allows unauthenticated GET requests and WebSocket connections
(read-only streams).
Mutating endpoints (POST/PATCH/DELETE) always require auth when a token is set.
This enables exposing the console publicly as a read-only demo while requiring
a token for configuration changes. WebSocket uses auth-via-first-message
(not query param) when read_open is disabled.

## Management Socket

Listens on `{socket_path}.mgmt`. Newline-terminated text commands.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `AUTH <token>` | Authenticate for PURGE (requires `PAGESPEED_PURGE_TOKEN` env var) |
| `PURGE <hostname> <url>` | Delete all variants for URL (auth required) |
| `STATS` | JSON stats with counters, timing, cache stats |
| `METRICS` | Prometheus text exposition format |
| `BROWSER-STATUS` | JSON browser analysis status (Chrome state, queue, profiles) |

## Notification Deduplication

Uses an **in-memory processed set** (`processed_variants_`) to track which
`(url, hostname, alternateId)` combinations the worker has already written.
On successful variant write, the key is added to the set.  On the next
notification for the same combination, processing is skipped.

Uses an in-memory set instead of cache reads because Cyclone's write-around
RAM cache populates on reads but does NOT evict on writes.  A `ReadAlternate`
dedup check would pollute RAM with stale content that shadows the worker's
subsequent write.

`kFlagWorkerProcessed` metadata flag (bit 1) is still set on all worker-written
variants for future use (e.g., cross-process dedup after restart).

Variants written with `kFlagNeedsRevalidation` are NOT added to the processed
set, allowing re-processing once external CSS becomes available.  The set is
cleared on URL invalidation (purge) and bounded to 10,000 entries.

**Image incomplete-matrix gap-fill** (`image_incomplete_retries_`): When the
proactive image loop writes fewer variants than expected (e.g., due to cache
write failures from race conditions with nginx), the URL is NOT marked as
processed. This allows re-notification to fill the gaps. The loop's
`HasVariant()` check naturally skips existing alternates, writing only missing
ones. Capped at `kMaxIncompleteRetries` (3) to prevent infinite loops on
persistent failures. Counter: `image_incomplete_matrices`.

**Text processing cooldown** (`text_cooldown_expiry_`): Prevents tight
re-processing loops for HTML and CSS.  Map stores expiry times keyed by
`url|hostname`, bounded to 256 entries.  Three cooldown durations:
- **Tentative** (60s): Set before processing starts, prevents concurrent
  threads from processing the same URL.  Cleared on non-revalidation success.
- **Write failure** (60s): Reader contention on mmap handles.
- **Revalidation** (3s): Successful write with `kFlagNeedsRevalidation`.
  Throttles the CSS convergence loop while allowing timely re-processing
  once external stylesheets become available.

## HTML Processing

Two-pass pipeline: HtmlScanner (pass 1, metadata) → HtmlTransformFilter +
HtmlWriterFilter (pass 2).

**HTML convergence**: First processing may lack cached CSS. Variant written with
`kFlagNeedsRevalidation`. Nginx re-notifies on HIT. Re-processing injects critical
CSS once available, clears flag. All transforms are idempotent.

### Transforms (all in `HtmlTransformFilter`)

1. **Critical CSS injection** — Heuristic-based, viewport-aware `@media` filtering
   (px/em/rem, comma-separated query lists, conservative fallback for unrecognized).
   CSS selector escape handling: backslash-literal (`\:`) and hex (`\3a`) per
   CSS Syntax Module Level 3 §4.3.11. XSS prevention: null-byte stripping then
   `</style` check. Always includes `*`, `html`, `body`, `:root`, first 25 DOM
   elements, header/nav/hero patterns. Excludes footer/lazy/below-fold, depth > 10,
   `@media print`. Inside `@layer`, large `@media` blocks (>4KB) are filtered
   per-rule instead of included wholesale (`max_wholesale_media_bytes`).
   See `src/worker/critical_css_extractor.h`.
2. **LCP preload** — `<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high">` in
   `<head>` for LCP candidate detected by HtmlScanner. Includes `imagesrcset` and
   `imagesizes` when available. URL scheme validation rejects `javascript:`/`data:`.
   Also written to Early Hints sentinel with `image:` prefix. Both preloads are
   suppressed for an `<img>` inside `<picture>` (a `<source>` sibling may win
   selection — the preload could double-download); the `<img>` itself still gets
   `fetchpriority="high"`, which stays correct whichever source wins.
   Disable: `--no-lcp-preload`.
3. **Lazy load** — `loading="lazy"` on `<img>`/`<iframe>`. LCP candidate image gets
   `fetchpriority="high"` instead; without a candidate, the first *plausible* body
   image within the first-3-imgs window is promoted (none if no image qualifies).
   Implausible-LCP images (`IsUnlikelyLcpImage`: 0/1px dimensions, `hidden`,
   `display:none`/`visibility:hidden`) are never promoted AND never lazy-loaded
   at any position — lazy on a layout-less beacon makes browsers skip the load,
   breaking analytics. First 3 body images are not lazy-loaded when LCP candidate
   is set (above-fold guard); the first VISIBLE body iframe is exempt (likely
   above-fold embed). Invisible iframes (`IsInvisibleElement`, same evidence as
   images — the GTM-noscript tracking-frame shape) get no transform at any
   position and do not consume the exemption slot. Disable:
   `--no-lazy-load-images`.
4. **Image dimensions** — Injects `width`/`height` from cached image headers (no full
   decode). Disable: `--no-image-dimensions`.
5. **Preconnect injection** — Detects third-party origins from external resources
   and writes `preconnect:` (no-cors) or `preconnect-cors:` (CORS-mode) prefixed
   hints to the Early Hints sentinel, enabling nginx to emit
   `Link: <origin>; rel=preconnect` headers. The injected HTML preconnect carries
   `crossorigin` exactly when the first-seen resource for that origin fetches in
   CORS mode (explicit `crossorigin` attribute, ES module script, font preload) —
   browsers key connection reuse on request mode, so the warmed pool must match.
   Disable: `--no-preconnect-injection`.
6. **Async CSS loading** — Makes render-blocking `<link rel="stylesheet">`
   elements non-blocking by switching each to `rel="preload" as="style"`
   (original media recorded in `data-pagespeed-media`, live `media` dropped —
   on a preload it is a fetch condition, not applicability). A CSP-safe
   external loader flips `rel` back to `stylesheet` and restores the media once
   the sheet has arrived. `as="style"` is load-bearing twice over: it gives the
   fetch the priority a stylesheet deserves (`media="print"` earned Lowest),
   and it is what the browser matches the preload against when the loader turns
   THIS SAME element into its consumer — a mismatch downloads the sheet twice,
   so the loader never creates a second `<link>`. Being a real preload also
   makes the sheet Early-Hints eligible again (see the interplay note below).
   The transform injects ONE external
   `<script defer src="/pagespeed_static/async_css.<hash>.js" data-pagespeed-async-loader>`
   per document, where `<hash>` is content-derived (FNV-1a) from the loader body
   so a loader change yields a fresh, immutable-cacheable URL (single source of
   truth: `async_css_loader.{h}` =
   `kAsyncCssLoaderPath`/`kAsyncCssLoaderJs`; served by the nginx module and the
   .NET middleware). No inline `onload`, so it works under `script-src 'self'`.
   A `<noscript>` fallback (marked `data-pagespeed-async-fallback`, carrying
   `integrity`/`crossorigin`) covers non-JS clients. The inlined critical CSS
   paints first. Applied whenever critical CSS is injected AND it is sufficient
   to bridge first paint (gate: `!disable_async_css && has_critical_css &&
   CriticalCssIsSufficient(...)` — the pessimistic of the extracted-bytes
   ratio and the browser profile's rule-level coverage (when known) must be
   ≥ `async_css_min_coverage` (default 0.10; profile coverage is only trusted
   downward — it can over-report vs. the bytes actually inlined, the #879
   FOUC), unless the deferred sheet is below
   `async_css_min_deferred_bytes` (default 15000). Below the floor, async-CSS is
   suppressed — the critical CSS is still inlined but the stylesheet stays
   render-blocking, avoiding a flash of unstyled content; `async_css_suppressed_low_coverage`
   counts these. The policy `async_css_recommended` signal is telemetry, NOT
   consulted by the gate). **Cold-cache fail-safe:** when a declared
   external stylesheet was not resolved from cache (`external_css_missing`),
   `CriticalCssIsSufficient` returns false unconditionally — the deferred-byte
   denominator is then the inline-only blob and the critical CSS was derived
   without the sheet, so the small-sheet escape hatch would otherwise async-defer
   an unmeasured sheet (the iispeed.com FOUC). The variant is marked
   `kFlagNeedsRevalidation` when a **same-origin** external sheet is missing (NOT
   gated on `!critical_css_injected()`, which a degenerate inline echo would
   trip; and NOT for cross-origin sheets such as Google Fonts, which can never
   enter the cache and would otherwise re-notify forever), so the decision
   self-heals once a cacheable sheet caches. The async-CSS *suppression* itself
   still keys on any `external_css_missing` (cross-origin included), so those
   pages stay render-blocking and FOUC-free — they just never upgrade to async.
   **Empirical gate (the byte floor is necessary, not sufficient):** the ratio
   above is a proxy — it can clear while the inlined block still fails to cover
   the fold. Deferral additionally requires a POSITIVE validation record on the
   viewport profile the critical block was derived from, and that record must
   still be bound to the stylesheet being served:
   `critical_css_validated && validated_combined_css_hash ==
   CombinedCssValidationHash(combined_css)` (`AsyncCssValidatedForServedSheet`).
   Consequences, all deliberate: the **heuristic path never defers** (no
   profile, no record, and none obtainable); a **stylesheet-only redeploy**
   invalidates the record even though `TemplateDetector::HashStructure` covers
   only the tag tree and cannot see it; and an **empty combined sheet** hashes
   to nothing matchable, so the `deferred_css_bytes == 0` free pass can no
   longer defer a real `<link>` against a decision made from no stylesheet at
   all. Async-CSS is therefore a warm-cache, analyzed-page optimization: a page
   whose analysis has not completed keeps its stylesheet render-blocking, with
   the critical CSS still inlined. `async_css_suppressed_unvalidated` counts
   these refusals, separately from the low-coverage counter, because the
   operator action differs. `--unsafe-force-async-css` (CLI-only, diagnostic)
   bypasses the whole gate by design.
   **A record covers ONE block (issue #1216):** the accept test reads the
   profile's bit and the stylesheet hash, and neither says which critical block
   is being inlined. When `DeriveDomMatchedCriticalCss` comes back EMPTY for the
   page being served, the block the record was produced about is not the block
   that ships — the heuristic fallback substitutes its own, or nothing is
   inlined — while the record still reads as healthy. `AsyncCssRecordForDerivedBlock`
   therefore drops the record at the derivation site, before the gate ever sees
   it (`async_css_record_dropped_empty_derivation` counts the drops). The byte
   floor cannot stand in for this: under `async_css_min_deferred_bytes` the
   small-sheet escape hatch clears whatever the coverage is, and an empty
   derivation pins `critical_css_coverage` at 0 for the substituted block
   anyway. Today's two extractors happen to make the substitution unreachable —
   the fallback matches the same DOM through a strictly less inclusive matcher,
   so an empty derivation implies an empty fallback — but that is a property of
   the two matchers, not of the gate, and the gate is where it has to hold.
   **Who produces the record** (`src/browser/critical_css_validator.{h,cc}`,
   driven from `BrowserAnalysisManager::RunCriticalCssValidation`): during
   analysis, per viewport, the manager derives the candidate block with the
   SAME `DeriveDomMatchedCriticalCss` the serve path inlines, synthesizes two
   documents from the page's PRE-INLINE markup (every stylesheet `<link>` and
   every `<style>` stripped, then exactly one injected — the reference gets the
   full combined sheet, the candidate gets the critical block, and the pair is
   checked to differ nowhere else), and renders both through
   `VisualRegressionGate::Compare`. Diff ≤ `kDefaultValidationDiffThreshold`
   (0.005, measured — see the constant's comment) stamps the record.
   Three things are load-bearing and easy to break:
   (a) the **pre-inline** HTML — `AnalysisContext::html_content` has the sheet
   inlined for coverage, so building the candidate from it would hand the
   candidate the whole sheet and validate everything;
   (b) the combined sheet comes from `Worker::BuildCombinedCss` through the
   injected `set_combined_css_builder` seam, never a second assembly, or every
   record fails the serve-time hash comparison and the feature is inert;
   (c) every failure path (no Chrome, injector abort, screenshot failure,
   oversized document, a comparison over zero pixels) records NOTHING, and
   `ApplyValidationVerdict` clears before it writes.
   Cost: 2 renders per viewport, 6 per template, on templates that reach the
   gate. Skipped when `ShouldInlineCriticalCss` already suppresses, when no
   block was produced, and when `external_css_missing` (the record could not
   match at serve time anyway).
   THREE blind spots, all named in `critical_css_validator.h`: (1) JS-off and
   (2) all-subresources-blocked are the validation render's SSRF defense, so
   both documents lose them equally — only the rendered probe lane
   (`tools/async-css-probe`) covers that class; (3) the record hangs off the
   TEMPLATE profile, whose hash ignores classes/ids, so a sibling page defers on
   another page's confirmation against a block re-derived for its own DOM.
   Deliberate (plan Q6: per-page hashing would invalidate nearly everything),
   unmitigated, and the reason `--no-async-css` stays one command away.
   LIFETIME: `validation_gate_` is a manager member destroyed BEFORE `chrome_`
   in both `OnChromeExit` and `Shutdown`. An in-flight comparison holds a raw
   `CdpClient*` and a 60 s uv timer, and once the client dies that timer is the
   only path that can complete the capture — reverse the order and it fires
   into freed memory on the COMMON path, not a rare one.
   The shared `CriticalCssIsSufficient` is also called by the in-process
   `ps_html_process` (.NET) path for parity — **but the empirical gate is not**,
   and cannot be: that path has no browser and no profile, so it can never
   produce a validation signal. `ps_html_process` keeps its byte-ratio floor
   plus the `external_css_missing` fail-safe, and its `enable_async_css`
   defaults to off, so an embedder turning it on has made a deliberate choice.
   The lower-level `ps_html_transform_create` had no sufficiency gate at all and
   now ignores the flag outright (see `lib/pagespeed/pagespeed.cc`).
   **CSP/inline coupling:** deferral is only safe because the inlined block
   paints the fold meanwhile, so when the inline injection is REFUSED (a
   restrictive meta CSP, or a `</style` terminator in the block) the filter
   reverts every conversion it made in that pass — `HtmlTransformFilter::
   RevertAsyncCss` at `EndDocument`. The `MetaCspAllowsInlineStyle()` check at
   `StartElement` is only an early-out: a `<link>` in source order BEFORE the
   CSP `<meta>` is converted without having seen that policy.
   Revalidation:
   `RemoveAsyncCssMarkers` restores `rel="stylesheet"` + media, drops `as`,
   and strips the markers; the old `<noscript>` fallback and loader `<script>`
   are deleted and re-injected. Restoring `rel` is the load-bearing half: a
   link left at `rel="preload"` with the loader gone downloads the sheet and
   applies nothing. `HtmlScanner` matches the deferred primary on
   `rel="preload"` + `data-pagespeed-async` (not on `rel=preload` alone, which
   would swallow LCP/font preloads) and reports its RECORDED media, so the
   stylesheet list is the same on the raw and reprocessed passes.
   Early Hints interplay: stylesheets the transform defers ARE preload-hinted
   — the primitive is itself a preload, so the hint announces exactly the
   fetch the markup announces, only earlier (`ParseHintLine` renders a bare
   sentinel line as `rel=preload; as=style`). Accepted cost: at style priority
   the sheet competes with the LCP image hint. `media="print"` sheets are
   always omitted. When reprocessing leaves the hint list empty, the stale
   sentinel is removed rather than left behind — otherwise the 103 path would
   keep promoting a resource the page no longer wants.
   Disable: `--no-async-css`.
7. **Script deferral** — Adds `defer` to `<script src="...">` identified as safe
   by browser script analysis. Evidence-based: only scripts the analysis browser
   actually fetched (same-origin, present in cache, served via Fetch
   interception) and observed idle before FCP earn a defer verdict; a script
   the analysis could not observe classifies `kNoCoverageData` and is never
   deferred. Path-boundary suffix matching. Skips scripts with
   `async`, `defer`, or `type="module"`. Revalidation: strips `data-pagespeed-defer`.
   Disable: `--no-script-deferral`.

## CSS Processing

Read CSS → `FlattenImports()` → `MinifyCss()` → write variant.
`@import` flattening inlines cached dependencies (depth limit 5, circular detection,
relative URL resolution, media query wrapping). Disable: `--no-css-import-flattening`.
Flattening is all-or-nothing per sheet: any uninlinable import → the original is
minified instead, and since CSS variants have no revalidation (only HTML does),
the skip heals only at TTL expiry/purge. See `lib/css/css_import_flattener.h`.

## Pre-Compressed Text Variants

After writing an identity (uncompressed) text variant (HTML, CSS, or JS), the worker
produces up to 2 additional alternates: gzip and brotli. This enables the nginx module
to serve pre-compressed content without on-the-fly compression overhead.

- Controlled by `--gzip-level N` (1-9, default 6, 0=disable) and
  `--brotli-level N` (1-11, default 6, 0=disable).
- Worker compresses at level 6 (offline, higher quality). Nginx's dynamic
  compression fallback uses level 4 (latency-sensitive). This means
  pre-compressed variants are smaller than nginx's on-the-fly fallback.
- Images are excluded (already format-compressed).
- For CSS/JS where minification doesn't reduce size ("already minimal"), compressed
  variants of the original content are still written.
- `origin_content_type` from the original alternate's metadata is propagated to
  compressed variants so nginx can set the correct `Content-Type` header
  (critical for extensionless HTML URLs like `/` or `/about`).
- Implementation: `WriteCompressedVariants()` helper in worker.cc,
  `text_compressor.{h,cc}` for compression primitives.

## Proactive Image Variants

Single decode → encode to all missing format/viewport/density/save-data combinations.
Up to 36 variants per notification (3 formats x 3 viewports x 2 densities x 2
save-data). Disable individually: `--no-proactive-image-variants`,
`--no-proactive-viewport-variants`, `--no-proactive-savedata-variants`,
`--no-proactive-density-variants`.

Incomplete matrices (fewer variants written than expected) are not marked as
processed, allowing re-notification to fill gaps. Counter:
`image_incomplete_matrices` (in STATS/METRICS). Retry cap: 3 attempts per URL.

renewal, no heartbeat, no telemetry. The only egress is
operator-configured: origin content fetches and the Web Bot Auth / RSL-CAP JWKS
key directories named on the command line.

`kLlmsTxtSentinel = 0xFFFFFFFD` (capability_mask.h),
`kOriginRefreshedSentinel = 0xFFFFFFFC` (capability_mask.h, issue #652 —
nginx re-fetched expired origin content and re-recorded the fresh body at
the identity id; the worker purges the stale NON-identity variants,
preserves the fresh identity, clears dedup, and rebuilds the variant set
inline; rate-limited per URL),
`SentinelId::kEarlyHints` (alternate_id.h),
`SentinelId::kBrowserProfile` (alternate_id.h).

## Browser Analysis Integration

When `--enable-browser-analysis` is set and Chrome is available, the worker uses
headless Chrome (CSS Coverage API + PerformanceObserver) to generate per-template
`OptimizationProfile` data, replacing heuristic critical CSS with browser-validated
results.

### Architecture

`BrowserAnalysisManager` owns Chrome lifecycle, analysis queue, and the CDP pipeline.
It runs on the main libuv event loop (where CDP must operate). Worker thread pool
threads enqueue analysis requests via `uv_async_send()`.

### Flow

1. Worker thread: `HtmlScanner::Scan()` succeeds
2. Worker thread: `TemplateDetector::HashStructure()` computes template hash
3. Worker thread: `LookupProfile()` checks cache for existing profile
4. If profile found: use browser-validated critical CSS instead of heuristic
5. If no profile: `EnqueueAnalysis()` + `uv_async_send()` to main loop
6. Main loop: `DrainQueue()` → `RunAnalysis()` → CSS cache inlining, `<base
   href>` injection (absolute page URL, skipped when the author set one) and
   the analysis resource map build (same-origin cached script bytes, served
   to Chrome via Fetch interception) → CSS extraction + page analysis for all
   3 viewports (Mobile 375x667, Tablet 768x1024, Desktop 1440x900) → script
   coverage pass (Desktop). Mapped scripts EXECUTE during page analysis, so
   LCP/CLS/fold telemetry comes from a script-executed render (intended
   behavior change)
7. Profile stored in cache at `OptimizationProfile::CacheUrl(hash)` with
   `SentinelId::kBrowserProfile`

### Error Handling

All failures fall back to the heuristic path. Browser analysis is strictly additive:
- Chrome won't start → heuristic only, retry after 2s
- Chrome crashes → cancel analysis, restart after 2s
- Analysis timeout → skip item, process next
- Cache read fails → skip item
- Queue full → head-drop oldest item

### CSS Cache Inlining

Before passing HTML to Chrome, `InlineCachedStylesheets()` (in
`css_cache_inliner.h/.cc`) resolves `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags against
the Cyclone cache and injects `<style>` blocks into the HTML. This enables
Chrome's CSS Coverage API to compute real coverage instead of returning 0%.

Pipeline: HtmlScanner -> cache lookup -> FlattenImports -> XSS sanitize -> inject.
When flattening skips (all-or-nothing), the original sheet — imports intact — is
inlined for the analysis browser, which cannot fetch them: coverage may
under-measure in mixed-cache states until the import tree is fully cached.
Guards: 50 stylesheet cap, 2MB per-stylesheet cap, 10MB total HTML cap.
Stats: `css_inlining_attempted`, `css_inlining_stylesheets_cached`,
`css_inlining_bytes_inlined` (in BROWSER-STATUS, STATS, METRICS).

### Stats (STATS JSON / METRICS Prometheus)

Browser stats in `browser` object: `profiles_generated`, `profiles_used`,
`analysis_errors`, `chrome_crashes`, `queue_depth`, `scripts_analyzed`,
`scripts_deferrable`, `scripts_no_coverage` (evidence-free verdicts — scripts
the analysis browser could not observe), `script_map_scripts_found`,
`script_map_scripts_cached`, `script_map_scripts_uncached_same_origin`
(healable cache-cold misses; the cold-script TTL-heal trigger),
`script_map_scripts_empty_same_origin` (cached but zero-length; unhealable,
excluded from the heal trigger),
`script_map_scripts_cross_origin`, `script_map_scripts_oversize` (cached but
over the per-entry/total map caps; unhealable, excluded from the heal
trigger), `script_map_bytes_mapped`, `script_fetches_served`,
`script_fetches_blocked` (Fetch-interception outcomes in the coverage pass),
`css_inlining_attempted`, `css_inlining_stylesheets_cached`,
`css_inlining_bytes_inlined`. Full detail via `BROWSER-STATUS` management command.

## Optimization Policy Engine

Per-URL optimization policy computed from browser analysis profiles. The policy
engine decides whether to enable optional transforms (async CSS, script deferral)
based on measured page characteristics.

### Policy Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `async_css_enabled` | bool | Enable async CSS loading for this URL |
| `script_deferral_enabled` | bool | Enable script deferral for this URL |

### Integration Flow

1. Browser analysis generates an `OptimizationProfile` (CSS coverage, script analysis)
2. `ComputePolicy()` evaluates profile data against thresholds
3. Policy result is stored with the profile in cache
4. HTML processing reads the policy and conditionally enables transforms

### Stats Counters

| Counter | Prometheus metric | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `policy.computed` | `pagespeed_policy_computed_total` | Optimization policies computed |
| `policy.async_css_enabled` | `pagespeed_policy_async_css_enabled_total` | Times async CSS was enabled by policy |
| `policy.async_css_suppressed_low_coverage` | `pagespeed_async_css_suppressed_low_coverage_total` | Times async CSS deferral was suppressed by the FOUC sufficiency gate (critical CSS too thin) |
| `policy.async_css_suppressed_unvalidated` | `pagespeed_async_css_suppressed_unvalidated_total` | Times async CSS deferral was suppressed because the page has no validation record bound to the stylesheet being served (not analyzed yet, or the stylesheet changed since) |
| `policy.async_css_record_dropped_empty_derivation` | `pagespeed_async_css_record_dropped_empty_derivation_total` | Times a profile's validation record was dropped before the gate because the DOM-matched derivation produced no critical block for the page being served (issue #1216) |
| `policy.script_deferral_enabled` | `pagespeed_policy_script_deferral_enabled_total` | Times script deferral was enabled by policy |

**Counter semantics (Issue E — these were dead/zero on prod before being wired
at the real decision site, not at the unused `OptimizationPolicy::Compute`).**
`policy.computed` increments once per HTML notification that reaches the
transform pass (i.e. past the no-transformation early-return) — it counts "a
policy decision was made", independent of whether the pass nets a change at the
later `modified()` check. `policy.async_css_enabled` / `policy.script_deferral_enabled`
increment when the corresponding feature (`has_async_css` /
`has_script_deferral`) is selected for that pass. The gate itself remains the
`transform_config` flags (e.g. async CSS = `!disable_async_css && has_critical_css`);
`OptimizationPolicy::Compute` stays telemetry-only and is NOT revived.

### Write-outcome counters (Issue E)

| Counter | Prometheus metric | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `alternates.writes` | `pagespeed_alternate_writes_total` | Alternate write attempts |
| `alternates.write_failures` | `pagespeed_alternate_write_failures_total` | HARD failures only (mmap/cache errors) |
| `alternates.writes_fenced` | `pagespeed_alternate_writes_fenced_total` | Benign writes dropped by a post-dispatch purge fence |
| `origin_refresh.purges` | `pagespeed_origin_refresh_purges_total` | Origin-refresh sentinels that purged a stale variant set |
| `origin_refresh.rate_limited` | `pagespeed_origin_refresh_rate_limited_total` | Origin-refresh sentinels rate-limited away |

`WriteVariant` returns false for both benign purge-fences and hard cache errors.
The failure branches now probe `purge_check()` first: a post-dispatch purge
(e.g. the content-hash invalidation purge earlier in the same notification)
counts as `alternates.writes_fenced` and does NOT touch `errors`. Only genuine
cache/mmap failures count as `alternates.write_failures` + `errors`. This ends
the prior `write_failures == content_hash_stale == errors` dashboard lockstep.

## SVG Auto-Vectorization

Automatic raster-to-SVG detection and conversion for logos, icons, and flat
illustrations. Three operational modes controlled by `--svg-mode`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `detect` | Evaluate candidacy, log scores. No vectorization. **(default)** |
| `preview` | Evaluate + vectorize + store SVG. Not served to clients. |
| `auto` | Full pipeline: evaluate, vectorize, store, serve. |

### Pipeline

```
Decode -> AnalyzeContent -> EvaluateSvgCandidacy -> PreprocessPixels
       -> VectorizeImage (VTracer FFI) -> SanitizeSvg -> PathCountGate
       -> SizeGate -> CacheWrite
```

SVG evaluation and vectorization are hoisted **before** the proactive raster
`(format, viewport, density, save-data)` loop. The image is decoded once at
original resolution, analyzed once, and vectorized once.

### Cache Behavior

SVG is resolution-independent. A single SVG variant serves all viewport classes,
pixel densities, and save-data states. Stored at the `kSvg` format slot
(`ImageFormat::kSvg = 3`, Desktop viewport). Pre-compressed gzip and brotli
variants are written alongside via `WriteCompressedVariants()`.

### LCP Exclusion

`--svg-exclude-lcp true` (default) skips SVG vectorization for images identified
as the LCP candidate by HtmlScanner or browser analysis. SVG render cost (path
tessellation) can regress LCP timing. Override with `--svg-exclude-lcp false`.

### SVG CLI Flags

```
--svg-mode MODE                 detect, preview, or auto (default: detect)
--svg-candidacy-threshold N     Score threshold (0-100, default 50)
--svg-max-pixels N              Max decoded pixels (default 65536)
--svg-max-paths N               Max <path> elements (default 500)
--svg-fidelity-threshold F      SSIMULACRA2 minimum (default 55.0)
--svg-exclude-lcp BOOL          Skip LCP images (default true)
--svg-timeout-ms N              Vectorization timeout (default 500)
--svg-preset N                  0=bw, 1=poster, 2=photo (default 1)
--svg-color-precision N         0=adaptive, 1-8=fixed (default 0)
--svg-filter-speckle N          Min cluster area (default 4)
```

All settings are hot-reloadable via `PATCH /v1/config`.
