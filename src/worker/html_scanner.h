// Candidate Largest Contentful Paint image detected by heuristic: the first
// eligible <img> in a hero container, else the first eligible body <img>.
// Eligible means a non-data: src, not IsUnlikelyLcpImage, and not inside
// <noscript>, <template>, <noembed> or <noframes>, which a browser running
// scripts never creates (the same `inert` rule as `elements`).
// That scope is the lexer's markup parse of <noscript> (kSometimesLiteralTags
// in lib/html/html_lexer.cc), not the browser's RAWTEXT rule, which ends the
// element at the first `</noscript>` byte sequence; the two diverge on a
// nested <noscript>, a `</noscript>` inside a comment or script string within
// the noscript, and a <noscript> inside <svg>. Where they differ the scanner's
// scope is the longer one, so an image the browser does create is skipped
// and a later real image is the candidate, which is the less harmful side.
//
// One shape yields no candidate at all (`script_loaded_hero`):
// the first hero container holds a lazy-load placeholder, an <img> without a
// usable src that a loader fills in (`<img data-src=hero.jpg class=lazy>`),
// followed by its <noscript> copy, and no eligible image of its own. Nothing in
// the markup says which bytes the loader fetches, so there is nothing right to
// hint, and hinting the next image instead (probably below the fold) is worse
// than no hint. Such a placeholder outside a hero container, or without the
// <noscript> copy, changes nothing: the next eligible image is the candidate.
//
// What counts as the placeholder:
//   1. no usable src (absent, empty, or `data:`) plus a lazy data attribute
//      (HasLazySourceAttribute) or a lazy-loader class;
//   2. a lazy data attribute plus a src whose file name is a common stand-in
//      (IsLazyStandInSrc: blank, placeholder, pixel, spacer, 1x1, transparent,
//      loading, lazy), such as `<img src=/blank.gif data-src=/hero.jpg>`;
//   3. inside a hero container only: a lazy data attribute plus any other src,
//      once its <noscript> copy turns out to carry a DIFFERENT src. The copy is
//      the author saying what the real image is, so the <img> is a stand-in
//      (a low-quality preview, say) whatever its own src. The copy comes after
//      the <img>, so until it is seen such an <img> is the candidate as before,
//      and it stays the candidate when no copy follows, or the copy has the
//      same src. "Same" is the resolved reference (host, path and query;
//      scheme and fragment dropped), so `http://example.com/hero.jpg` is
//      `/hero.jpg` while `/hero.jpg?v=2` is not known to be. A lazy-loader
//      class alone does not make a real src a stand-in (`<img src=/hero.jpg
//      class=lazy>` is the hero, and so is `<img src=/blank.gif class=lazy>`
//      whatever its copy says).
// In every leg the copy has to be a plausible one: a <noscript> image the
// markup declares invisible (IsUnlikelyLcpImage: 0/1 px, hidden) is a tracking
// pixel's no-JS fallback, not the author's copy of the hero, and confirms
// nothing. Legs 1 and 2 are IsLazyLoadPlaceholder in html_scanner.cc; the
// transform filter's own "no usable source" test shares leg 2 (never promoted
// by the fetchpriority fallback). The transform filter does not read srcset
// for leg 1 the way the scanner does: `<img src="data:..." srcset=/hero.jpg
// data-src=/x>` is a placeholder for the scanner (no usable src) and a
// loading image for the filter (it has a srcset).
//
// Inside the placeholder's hero container, an eligible image whose declared
// size is small (IsSmallDeclaredImage: width x height under
// kSmallImageAreaPx2, a 48x48 icon in the call-to-action) neither cancels the
// pattern nor becomes the candidate: with the <noscript> copy seen, the page
// gets no candidate. Without the copy the pattern is not confirmed, and the
// icon is what today's first-eligible-image rule picks, exactly as before; a
// page without a placeholder is not touched by this at all. An image without
// a declared size, or at or above the threshold, cancels the pattern as
// before (unknown is not small). The tolerance applies while a placeholder is
// pending: an icon that PRECEDES the placeholder in the container is the
// first eligible image and the candidate, as before.
