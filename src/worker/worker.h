  //              problem, and the counter that matters once notify peers ship
  //              on their own cadence.  Never counted as a parse error,
  //              because the frame was never parsed.
  //   _malformed a peer that agrees on the version but sent a truncated or
  //              corrupt frame — a transport or sender problem.
  //   _sentinel  a well-formed notification naming a reserved entry class
  //              this build does not accept as a notification trigger.
  //   _option_context
  //              a notification whose per-request option context FAILED
  //              VALIDATION at dispatch.  Three causes reach here, and they
  //              are the whole list: an unknown payload format, a malformed
  //              signature, and a signature that does not match its payload.
  //              An OVERSIZED payload does NOT land here — the frame reader
  //              bounds it with the same constant the validator uses, so it
  //              is refused a layer earlier and counted as _malformed (and
  //              the sending side refuses to emit one at all).  Nothing else
  //              lands here either: a context that validates is accepted
  //              whatever it names (see Worker::AcceptOptionContext), so this

  //              whereas an option-context refusal happens AT dispatch, so it
  //              does.  So received == refused + processed here, and received
  //              stays 0 for the other two.  That is deliberate -- "received"
  //              counts frames this build could parse -- but it means the
