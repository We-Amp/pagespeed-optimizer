// Whether a cached sub-resource may be used to build another URL's output.
//
// Outputs built from other URLs (a page's combined or inlined stylesheets,
// flattened @imports, image dimensions, /llms.txt summaries) are served to
// every client of the output, so they are built only from content the site
// serves to any client.  Before the worker uses another URL's cached bytes,
// it asks the site once with a HEAD request from its own fetcher (no
// cookies or credentials).  Only a 200 admits the URL; anything else, or no
// answer, counts as not admitted, and the caller treats the resource as
// absent.
//
// Answers are remembered per (site, scheme, host, URL) for a short time, so
// a page whose sub-resources are all public costs one request per
// sub-resource per memo period.  Reads of the notified URL's own bytes are
// not gated.
//
// For a page whose host the worker may not ask, a stylesheet or image the
// front end recorded from its response to an anonymous request
// (AlternateMetadata::kFlagAnonymousRecorded, carried by every variant the
// worker derives from it) is admitted without a request when it was read from
// the page's own site keyspace.  Where the worker may ask the host, a stamped
// entry is asked about like any other.
