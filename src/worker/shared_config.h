// Schema version this build writes and is able to read.  A file declaring a
// HIGHER version is not parsed at all (see ParseSharedConfig).
//
// BUMP HAZARD: src/nginx/ngx_pagespeed_module.cc carries an independent
// inline parser whose version gate is hardcoded, not derived from this
// constant.  Bumping this makes the daemon write the new version while that
// mirror falls back to its compiled-in defaults (loudly, but still) — update
// the mirror in the same change.
//
// AND NOTE WHAT THE HAZARD IMPLIES ABOUT WHEN TO BUMP.  The gate is a
// reader-side "I cannot read this at all": a reader that sees a higher version
// discards the ENTIRE file — socket path, every serve toggle — and runs on
// compiled-in defaults.  That is the right answer for a schema an
// old reader would MISREAD, and the wrong answer for one it can simply skip.
// Adding an optional key is the second case: ParseSharedConfig ignores unknown
// keys by contract, so every already-deployed reader keeps working unchanged
// and a bump would instead degrade all of them to defaults in exchange for
// announcing a key they do not need.  So: bump for a change in the meaning or
// the required set of existing keys; do NOT bump to add an optional key.
//
// Removing an optional key is the same case in the other direction (2.1):
// the daemon stopped writing license_key / license_valid /
// license_checked_once.  A 2.0 reader that still knows those keys simply
// sees them missing and keeps its defaults (no key, not valid, not yet
// checked — the last of which suppresses its warning header), so the schema
// version stays at 1 and the two sides remain mutually readable.

// daemon publishes N in pagespeed-shared.conf (cache_dir_generation=) so a
// peer compiled against a different N fails the handshake LOUDLY instead of
// silently opening a cold, empty sibling directory.
//
// Bump N (and the default directory) when:
//   1. the ownership/identity model changes in a way that makes prior content
//      unusable by a new install (N started at 1 for the H1 privilege drop —
//      no installer may chown or migrate root-owned cache content, so the
//      drop cold-starts into v1/);
//   2. cyclone's VolumeHeader::kFormatVersionMajor bumps;
//   3. any future event ruled in by a design decision.
// N counts SHIPPED generations, so triggers that fire before the current N has
// been released collapse into it rather than each costing a bump.  2.1 is that
// case: the H1 privilege drop introduced v1 and the cyclone format major went
// 6 -> 7 in the same unreleased train, so both triggers are satisfied by the
// single 0 -> 1 move.  No released binary has ever resolved a v1 directory, so
// there is no peer to skew against and nothing in v1 to be made unusable.  A
// format major that bumps AFTER 2.1 ships takes N to 2.

// inside the volume) or serve-stats layout changes (own namespace, own file).
