// Storability re-evaluation for the conditional-revalidation (304) restamp
// path.  Pure C++ (no nginx headers) so the decision logic is unit-testable
// without an nginx build (same pattern as etag_util / authz_cache_gate).
//
// Issue #1016.  A 304 answer to a conditional re-fetch merges the origin's
// refreshed Cache-Control into the stored entry's metadata and writes the
// entry back with a fresh cache_inserted_at.  The store-side storability
// checks, however, lived only in the header-filter MISS path, so the
// restamp re-freshened and persisted entries the shared cache is no longer
// allowed to hold: a 304 carrying `no-store` or `private`, or one that
// withdraws the RFC 9111 §3.5 permit an Authorization-bearing exchange
// needs, was written straight back.  This kernel is that missing gate,
// evaluated over the MERGED (post-restamp) flags — the same vocabulary the
// record path checks, so both paths agree on what "storable" means.
//
// This kernel decides RETENTION only.  The caller keeps serving the
// current requester exactly as before.  Whether a withdrawn §3.5 permit
// should additionally suppress that serve was adjudicated 2026-07-23 —
// see the kSkipRestamp verdict note below: the serve is compliant.
//
// Three verdicts, because "not storable" has two materially different
// causes and collapsing them would be wrong in both directions:
//
//   kRestamp     — refreshed headers are storable; write the entry back.
//
//   kEvict       — the refreshed headers say this representation must not
//                  live in a shared cache at all: `no-store`, or the BARE
//                  `private`.  The qualified form (`private="Set-Cookie"`,
//                  RFC 9111 §5.2.2.7) restricts only the named fields and
//                  explicitly permits storing the remainder, so it is NOT
//                  an eviction — treating it as one would destroy the
//                  entry and every derived variant on every revalidation,
//                  for an idiom origins pair with a cacheable `max-age`
//                  routinely.
//                  Declining the write-back is not enough: the PREVIOUSLY
//                  stored copy is the thing the origin just told us not to
//                  hold, and it would keep being served to other clients
//                  until its own TTL ran out.  The entry has to go.
//
//   kSkipRestamp — the entry is still legitimately storable, but THIS
//                  exchange may not extend its life: the requester carried
//                  Authorization and the refreshed Cache-Control no longer
//                  carries a §3.5 permit (public / must-revalidate /
//                  s-maxage), or the 304 carried Set-Cookie, which marks
//                  the exchange as personalized.  Deliberately NOT kEvict:
//                  §3.5 restricts storing the response to the AUTHENTICATED
//                  request, not the anonymous entry that was already
//                  lawfully stored — and evicting on an inbound header
//                  would hand any client a one-request shared-cache flush.
//                  Leaving the stale stamp in place is self-correcting: the
//                  entry simply revalidates again on the next request.
//                  Serving THIS requester the entry after the
//                  permit-withdrawing 304 is adjudicated compliant
//                  (operator decision, 2026-07-23): §4.3.4 lets a cache use
//                  the stored response on a 304, and that 304 answered a
//                  conditional request carrying the credentials — i.e.
//                  per-request permission from the origin, which regains
//                  full control on any 200 (the refreshed headers then
//                  restamp or evict).  The strict alternative — discard the
//                  304 and re-fetch unconditionally — buys an origin
//                  round-trip for no practical exposure, and was rejected.
//
// no-store / bare private dominate: an entry that must not be held is
// evicted regardless of any permit or personalization signal also present.
//
// Set-Cookie parity note: the MISS path treats a Set-Cookie response as
// uncacheable outright (it never stores).  Here the body was already stored
// under headers that permitted it, and a 304's Set-Cookie is typically a
// session refresh attached to the exchange rather than a statement about
// the representation — so the proportionate answer is to decline the
// life-extension, not to destroy a lawfully cached entry.
