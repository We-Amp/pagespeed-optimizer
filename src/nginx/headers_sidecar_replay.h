// Serve-side half of the response-header sidecar for the nginx front stage
// (issue #208).  Pure C++ (no nginx headers), so every decision the serve
// paths make about the stored header block is unit-testable without an
// nginx build.  The store side is headers_sidecar_record.h.
//
// THE RULE.  A response served from cache carries the same
// request-independent headers as the origin response it was recorded from.
// The record arm stores those lines verbatim in the URL's sidecar (one per
// URL, sentinel 0x6C) and marks every entry it records with two bits:
//
//   neither bit          recorded before the gate existed: serve exactly as
//                        before, no read, no replay;
//   classified only      the gate ran and there was nothing to carry: serve
//                        as before, no read;
//   classified+required  the URL's block MUST be read and replayed; a block
//                        that cannot be read makes the request a MISS (the
//                        record arm then rewrites it), never a hit without
//                        the headers.
//
// WHERE.  The handler reads the block once, right after the cache read and
// the RFC 9111 §3.5 gate and before the freshness decision, so "cannot be
// served with fidelity" is decided before any serving arm commits, and every
// served-from-cache path of the request — the fresh hit, the no-cache hit,
// the bounded coalesced stale serve, the stale-if-error serve — replays the
// same copy.  (The 304 restamp path merges the block with the 304's lines;
// see PlanRestampSidecar in headers_sidecar_record.h.)
//
// ORDER AND PRECEDENCE.  The stored lines go out first, verbatim and in
// stored order; then the serve path's own Vary, Cache-Control, Age, ETag.
// The two sets cannot collide: the gate never stores a name the entry
// metadata reproduces (Cache-Control, validators, Expires, Content-*) or one
// the serving stack stamps (Date, Age, ...), so the builder owns those and
// the block owns the rest.  Vary is a list header and both sides produce it:
// the origin's line first, then the computed one, and when the block carried
// a Vary the computed line does not repeat Accept (the origin's line already
// lists it) — exactly the shape a MISS sends.
//
// NOT REPLAYED onto the agent markdown variant: it is a separate
// representation with its own fixed header set.
