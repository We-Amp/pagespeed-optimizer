# HTML Parser

SAX-style streaming HTML parser with filter chain and DOM mutation support.
Ported from mod_pagespeed's `pagespeed/kernel/html/`.

## Key Files
- `html_parse.h` -- main parser class `HtmlParse` (~100 public methods)
- `html_filter.h` -- `HtmlFilter` base class for pipeline stages
- `html_element.h` -- `HtmlElement` (tags with attributes)
- `html_node.h` -- `HtmlNode` base, `HtmlLeafNode`, `HtmlCdataNode`, `HtmlCharactersNode`, etc.
- `html_event.h` -- event queue entries (StartElement, EndElement, Characters, etc.)
- `html_name.h` -- interned tag/attribute names (generated from `html_name.gperf`)
- `html_keywords.h` -- HTML entity/keyword lookup + tag close-style category tables
  (single source of truth for implicitly-closed / brief-termination tag sets)
- `html_lexer.h` -- tokenizer (internal to HtmlParse)
- `html_writer_filter.h` -- serializes parsed HTML back to text
- `empty_html_filter.h` -- no-op filter base for selective overrides
- `subresource_collector_filter.h` -- collects `<link>`, `<script>`, `<img>` URLs
- `doctype.h` -- DOCTYPE classification (exact-matching parser converged with
  mod_pagespeed 1.15; unrecognized doctypes degrade to `DocType::kUnknown`)
- `content_type.h` -- MIME type classification
- `html_parse_recorder.h` -- recording event sink for the
  differential harness (SPEC.md v1 parse event stream); drives
  `html_parse_probe` and `html_fuzz`. Corpus + goldens: vendored at
  `tools/html-parse-corpus/` (see its LOCAL_NOTES.md)

## Architecture

**Parser model**: `HtmlParse` tokenizes HTML into an event queue. Events flow through
a chain of `HtmlFilter`s. Filters can inspect and mutate the DOM during traversal.

**Lifecycle**: `StartParse(url)` → `ParseText(chunk)` (repeated) → `Flush()` → `FinishParse()`.
Supports streaming -- `Flush()` sends buffered events through the filter chain.

**Mutation**: Filters can insert, delete, move, and replace nodes during traversal.
Mutations are safe within the current flush window. Key methods:
`InsertNodeBeforeCurrent`, `InsertNodeAfterCurrent`, `DeleteNode`, `ReplaceNode`.

**Filter chain**: `AddFilter(filter)` before `StartParse`. Filters see events in order.
`HtmlWriterFilter` is typically the last filter (serializes output).

## Namespace
All symbols are in `net_instaweb::` (legacy from mod_pagespeed).

## Vendored kernel machinery (#1130, D1-pattern)

The HTML kernel is being vendored from the canonical 1.15 repo with the
same machinery as the D1 JS kernel (see `lib/js/CLAUDE.md` for the pattern
this clones):

- **Pin:** `lib/html/HTML_KERNEL_PIN` holds the canonical 1.15 commit SHA
  (first token of the first non-comment line — load-bearing contract) plus
  a keyword-keyed `floor <sha>` line for the pin-downgrade ratchet.
- **Sync:** `tools/sync-html-kernel.sh --source <path-to-1.15-checkout>`
  regenerates the vendored set from the pin (anchored `^#include` rewrites
  to `lib/html/`, `lib/html/compat/`, and `lib/base/` per the tool's fixed
  mapping table, plus a provenance banner; NO other source rewrites — a
  residue check fails the sync if canonical reintroduces the retired
  `StringPiece::CopyToString` member call). `--check` byte-compares without
  writing (used by CI).
- **Synced set (single-writer, NEVER hand-edit):** the 13-file scope
  (`html_lexer`, `html_parse`, `html_node`, `html_element`, `html_event`,
  `html_filter`, `html_keywords`, `html_name` (`.h`/`.gperf`), `doctype`,
  `html_writer_filter`, `empty_html_filter`, `content_type` — 24 files
  with headers) plus `html_parse_probe.cc` + `html_parse_recorder.h` (D1
  probe precedent: the D2 differential goldens gate both repos' probes, so
  the probe rides the pin) and the ledger `SYNCED_FILES.txt`.
- **Membership is explicit:** `tools/check-html-kernel-membership.sh` (run
  by the `html-kernel-differential` CI job and by the sync tool's
  `--check`) fails if any file exists under `lib/html/` that is neither
  listed in `SYNCED_FILES.txt` nor in the declared 2.0-owned set below.
  Unlike lib/js there is NO uniform vendored-name prefix — the optimizer-native
  files share the `html_*` shape — so both the carve-outs and this gate
  key on explicit name lists.
- **2.0-owned (editable):**
  - `compat/` — flat `.h`-only adaptation headers (`message_handler.h`,
    `google_url.h`, `string.h`, `string_util.h`, `logging.h`,
    `sparse_hash_map.h`, `string_hash.h`, `stl_util.h`, `timer.h`)
    standing in for the canonical headers the vendored kernel includes.
    `compat/` is optimizer-owned and NEVER synced: the sync rewrites vendored
    includes to land here, never writes into it. New compat headers must
    be added to `//lib/html:compat` hdrs and included by
    `test/lib/html/compat_headers_test.cc` in the same change.
  - optimizer-native filters/parsers: `subresource_collector_filter`,
    `sitemap_parser`, `markdown_extractor_filter`, `robots_ai_directives`,
    `llms_txt_formatter`, `html_metadata_extractor`, `safe_entity_decode`,
    `csp_inline_policy`, and the `html_fuzz.cc` harness.
  - `BUILD`, `CLAUDE.md`, `HTML_KERNEL_PIN`, `SYNCED_FILES.txt`,
    `LICENSE.apache-2.0`.
- **DEFERRED decision (restore real URL validation):** `compat/google_url.h`
  is the Tier-1 policy seam, NOT a URL parser. Its default
  `NonEmptyUrlPolicy` (valid iff non-empty, identity normalization) keeps
  2.0 behavior byte-identical. Whether 2.0 restores real URL validation is
  undecided; the header's file-top comment is the normative record, and
  plugging in a real policy needs no canonical-code change.
- **Cross-compat-set safety:** `compat/string_util.h` INCLUDES
  `lib/js/compat/string_util.h` rather than redefining `StringPiece` /
  `strings::{StartsWith,EndsWith}` — `src/worker/worker.cc` includes both
  kernels' public headers, so both compat sets appear in one TU and any
  duplicate function definition (or a canonical-style `using absl::` decl)
  there is a hard compile error. Identical-alias headers (`string.h`) may
  stand alone; function-defining headers may not. `compat/logging.h`
  macros are per-name `#ifndef`-guarded like D1's.
- **Ratchet / drift / behavior gates:** the REQUIRED
  `html-kernel-differential` job in `ci.yml` runs
  `tools/ci/check-floor-ratchet.sh --main-pin-path lib/html/HTML_KERNEL_PIN`
  (floor validity + forward-only vs origin/main, failing closed when a
  floor move cannot verify ancestry) and — once the first sync has landed —
  the membership gate; CI's HTML-kernel drift check
  re-runs the sync from the pin on PRs touching `lib/html/**`, pushes to
  main, weekly, and on dispatch (with the same mirror-ladder canonical
  access, hotfix valve, and staleness ladder as the JS workflow). Behavior
  stays gated by the vendored-goldens manifest check in the same
  differential job.
- **Availability dependency (#1117):** a floor MOVE (any pin bump) in the
  required job fails closed when the canonical 1.15 repo is unreachable
  from the runner — with a broken deploy key or an upstream outage,
  pin-bump PRs are unmergeable until reachability is restored. Equality
  (no-bump PRs) needs no canonical access and is unaffected. Scope: the
  required layer verifies floor/pin LINEAGE only, never the vendored
  bytes; byte-vs-canonical verification lives in the advisory drift
  workflow.

## Carve-outs (and their limits)

Vendored files keep canonical 1.15 idiom/formatting: they are excluded from
clang-tidy TU selection and header diagnostics, clang-format, and the
pre-commit fixers — keyed on the EXPLICIT vendored-name list (the 13-file
scope; asserted by the sync tool's vendored-name invariant and made
non-spoofable by the membership gate). They are NOT excluded from the
license gate (the banner carries SPDX), sanitizers, tests, or the
differential job. The optimizer-native lib/html files and `compat/` are normal 2.0 code:
fully linted, formatted, and reviewed.

## Testing
```bash
bazel test //test/lib/html/...
```

## Gotchas
- Namespace is `net_instaweb::`, not `pagespeed::` -- this is legacy from mod_pagespeed.
- `HtmlName` uses a gperf-generated perfect hash; regenerate after modifying `html_name.gperf`.
- Flush window limits which nodes can be mutated -- nodes outside the window are read-only.
- `DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN` macro still used (legacy); new code should use `= delete`.
