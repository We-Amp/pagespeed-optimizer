/* Adding entry points is a MINOR bump: every function that existed at 1.0 is
 * still present with the same signature, so a consumer built against 1.0 keeps
 * linking. 1.1 adds ps_serve_stats_record_serve_class and
 * ps_serve_stats_snapshot. 1.2 adds the origin-state write fields and their
 * read accessors, the freshness / Cache-Control / Vary-storability entry
 * points, and ps_write_params_init_sized. 1.3 adds ps_cache_write_original.
 * 1.4 adds ps_cache_write_headers_sidecar and ps_headers_sidecar_classify.
 * 1.5 adds the per-request options context: ps_notify_worker_ex with its
 * ps_notify_params_t, and ps_option_context_signature. 1.6 adds
 * ps_read_shared_config_volume_size and ps_cache_config_init_sized. 1.7 adds
 * ps_vary_varies_accept and publishes PS_FLAG_ORIGIN_VARIES_ACCEPT. 1.8
 * publishes PS_FLAG_ORIGIN_HEADERS_NOT_REPRODUCIBLE. 1.9 adds
 * ps_html_config_init_sized and ps_critical_css_config_init_sized. 1.10
 * adds ps_read_shared_config_generation.
 *
 * A published constant is ABI surface too (see ABI.md), so a minor that adds
 * only one still moves the number: it is what a consumer compiles against to
 * know the constant is there.
 *
 * The rules this triple obeys, and the CI gate that enforces them, are
 * documented in lib/pagespeed/ABI.md. In short: removing or renaming an
 * exported symbol, or moving a field within a published struct, is a MAJOR
 * bump; adding a symbol, or appending a field to a struct that carries
 * struct_size, is a MINOR bump. lib/pagespeed/abi/abi-golden.json is the
 * checked-in record of the current surface and is what the gate compares
 * against. */

 * the set a later serve can reproduce, and that is exactly what this bit
 * records. (Those two verdicts, not "anything that is not SWAP_ELIGIBLE" —
 * the call also returns -1 for a malformed argument list, which is a bug in
 * the call and not a statement about the response.) On a hit the origin's
 * headers are gone, so nothing downstream can re-derive it.
 *
 * WHERE THE BIT LIVES, which decides how you read it back. It is on the ONE
 * entry the writer stamped, and nowhere else:
 *
 *   - Optimizer-produced variants do NOT carry it. Every optimizer write path
 *     composes the flags byte of what it stores, and none of them forwards
 *     this bit — so every derived variant reads back with this bit clear,
 *     whatever the entry it was optimized from carried.
 *   - A durable original (ps_cache_write_original) is never returned by
 *     ps_cache_read_best — that class is excluded from selection by design.
 *     So a serve path that wants the marker must ask for the entry by id:
 *     ps_cache_read_alternate(..., PS_SENTINEL_ORIGINAL, &r) then
 *     ps_read_flags(r). Reading it off a best-fit result instead gets you an
 *     unmarked variant and a false all-clear.
 *   - If you stamped it on an ordinary entry through ps_cache_write_begin, it
 *     lives at that alternate id — including the default-mask id the
 *     optimizer's own output uses. Such a marker is visible on the hits before
 *     optimization lands and gone afterwards, because the optimizer's write
 *     replaces the entry with one whose flags it composed itself.
 *
 * ADVISORY, and it gates nothing in the library: admission stores a marked
 * response exactly as an unmarked one, scoring never reads the flags byte, and
 * the optimizer neither refuses nor prefers a marked entry. What a reader may
 * conclude is only that answering from that entry would drop headers the
 * origin sent. A serve path that cannot reproduce them serves its plain path
 * instead, which turns a silent fidelity gap into a visible fall-through.
 * Leaving the bit clear costs nothing but that visibility — unlike
 * PS_FLAG_ORIGIN_VARIES_ACCEPT, omitting it cannot produce wrong bytes.
 *
 * One effect is observable wherever a marked entry is actually served: the
 * flags byte feeds the weak ETag of a hit, so a marked entry does not validate
 * against an otherwise identical unmarked one. That is deliberate — the two
 * are served differently, so they are not the same representation.

/* Write the durable ORIGINAL of a resource — the bytes the origin sent, before

 * Takes the same ps_write_params_t as ps_cache_write_begin and uses the same
 * fields, with two differences:
 *
 *   - `alternate_id` is not yours to choose. Leave it 0 (or set it to
 *     PS_SENTINEL_ORIGINAL); any other value is PS_ERR_INVALID_ARG. The class
 *     has exactly one id, which is what lets "the original" mean one thing.
 *   - `full_mask`'s low byte must be 0 or PS_SENTINEL_ORIGINAL; the stored
 *     entry always describes itself as this class.
 *
 * The entry is NOT selectable: no request, of any shape, can be served it by
 * ordinary cache selection. It is read back deliberately, by id, with
 * ps_cache_read_alternate(..., PS_SENTINEL_ORIGINAL).
 *
 * HOW LONG IT LIVES is the origin's decision, not a fixed retention: supply
 * the origin's Cache-Control state and validators in the params exactly as you
 * would for any other write, and the entry is usable for as long as those say
 * the origin's answer stands. Leaving cache_inserted_at at 0 stamps the local
 * clock, as elsewhere.
 *
 * SIZE LIMIT: 16 MB. A larger response is not stored as a durable original —
 * above that size the copy costs more than the rebuild it saves. There is no
 * way to change it from this API, and no shipped configuration sets it, so
 * treat it as a fixed property of the library.
 *
 * Declaring more than the limit returns PS_ERR_NO_SPACE here; writing more
 * than you declared fails the ps_write_data call that crosses it and abandons
 * the entry, after which ps_write_close returns PS_ERR_CLOSED because there is
 * nothing left to commit. Nothing partial is ever stored, and no other part of
 * your response handling is affected. All three carry a ps_last_error_message
 * that names the cap — worth checking, because PS_ERR_NO_SPACE also means the
 * cache volume is genuinely full, which is transient and worth retrying, while
 * this is permanent for this response and is a normal outcome to log.
 *
 * RE-RECORDING REPLACES, with the same scope the header sidecar's block
 * carries and one extra consequence:
 *
 *   - A read always gets the most recent original, under any interleaving.
 *   - With ONE WRITER per URL, re-recording replaces: the previous original
 *     is removed before the new one is written.
 *   - With CONCURRENT WRITERS for the same URL, superseded originals can
 *     accumulate — the removal and the write are separate operations with no
 *     atom across them, and the depth does not come back down by itself. It
 *     is bounded (the storage layer stops accepting alternate writes for that
 *     key at its chain ceiling, which is loud rather than silent), but for
 *     THIS class each superseded node holds a whole response body, so it
 *     costs volume as well as depth. If you write originals for the same URL
 *     from several processes, serialise them. Unconditional replacement
 *     arrives with the next storage-layer advance and needs no change on your
 *     side.
 *
 * REPLACEMENT WINDOW, and it is wider here than anywhere else because this is
 * a streaming write: the previous original is removed when you call this, and
 * the new one exists only when you CLOSE the handle. For the whole duration
 * of your stream there is no stored original for that URL, and a stream you
 * abandon, one whose close the storage layer refuses (it can — at its chain
 * ceiling, or out of space), or one the size limit cuts off leaves none. A
 * reader in that
 * window gets a miss, which correctly means "no original is stored"; the cost
 * is a re-fetch, never wrong bytes. If keeping a stale original matters more
 * to you than the gap, read for one before you start writing and decide.
 *
 * `Vary: Accept` OBLIGATION — the one thing this call cannot do for you, and
 * the one whose omission is silent. If the response's `Vary` says the ORIGIN
 * negotiates on `Accept` (ask ps_vary_varies_accept), you MUST set
 * PS_FLAG_ORIGIN_VARIES_ACCEPT in params->flags. The optimizer treats a
 * durable original as an input it may derive a variant family from, and that
 * flag is the ONLY thing that stops it: on a hit the origin's `Vary` is gone,
 * so the bit on the entry is the whole record. Omit it and every later client
 * is served variants transcoded from whichever representation the FIRST
 * requester's `Accept` elicited — wrong bytes, no error, nothing downstream
 * able to notice. Responses ps_vary_uncacheable refuses must not be stored at
 * all, here or anywhere.
 *
 * HEADER-FIDELITY MARKER, the other thing only you can answer while the
 * response's headers are in hand: if its complete header set carries anything
 * outside what a later serve can reproduce — ask ps_headers_sidecar_classify,
 * where a PS_SIDECAR_FALL_THROUGH or PS_SIDECAR_NEVER_OPTIMIZED verdict means
 * it does (those two verdicts; -1 is a malformed call, not a statement about
 * the response) — set PS_FLAG_ORIGIN_HEADERS_NOT_REPRODUCIBLE in
 * params->flags. Unlike the `Vary` marker this one gates nothing: the entry
 * is stored and optimized identically either way. It exists so that a serve
 * path can fall through to its plain path instead of answering with headers
 * it knows are incomplete — which works only if the serve path reads the bit
 * where it lives: on THIS entry, which selection never returns, so it must be
 * read back by id. See "WHERE THE BIT LIVES" in the
 * PS_FLAG_ORIGIN_HEADERS_NOT_REPRODUCIBLE block above.
 *
 * CONCURRENCY CONSTRAINT — read this before building a producer on it. A
 * durable original committed by THIS call is not fenced against a concurrent
 * purge of the same URL. The engine's own purge fencing is internal to the
 * optimizer process: it stops the optimizer's tasks from writing across a
 * purge, and it cannot see your write at all. So a store that commits after a
 * purge has enumerated the URL's entries survives with its family gone — an
 * original outliving the response it belongs to. Nothing in the shipped engine
 * produces originals yet, so this cannot arise today; a production writer of
 * this class has to close it (a cross-process fence, or re-checking after the

 *     accumulate. The removal and the write are separate operations with no
 *     atom across them, so two calls can interleave and leave two, and the
 *     depth does not come back down by itself. It is bounded — the storage
 *     layer stops accepting alternate writes for that key at its chain
 *     ceiling, which is a loud failure rather than a silent one — but if you
 *     write this class from several processes for the same URL, serialise
 *     them. Unconditional replacement arrives with the next storage-layer
 *     advance and needs no change on your side.
 *
 * A REMOVAL WINDOW comes with it, and a serve path must inherit one rule from
 * it: between the removal and the commit a reader finds NO block, and if the
 * write then fails the previous block is gone with nothing in its place. A
 * missing block must therefore mean "this response is not optimizable" and
 * never "optimized, with no headers" — otherwise that window is exactly the
 * bug this class exists to prevent.
 *
 * Read it back by id with
 * ps_cache_read_alternate(..., PS_SENTINEL_HEADERS_SIDECAR): what you get is
 * the WHOLE payload, starting with its format version byte. That the entry
 * metadata parse does not consume any of it is guaranteed, not incidental —
 * this class's format version is constrained to a range no entry-metadata
 * version can occupy, and that constraint is part of the ABI (see ABI.md). A
 * reader that does not know the version byte must treat the entry as absent.
