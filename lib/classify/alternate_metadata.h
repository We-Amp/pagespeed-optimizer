  //
  // What it does NOT do, stated because a flag byte invites the assumption:
  // it does not gate storage or admission (a marked response is stored

  // (which scores the capability bits of the AlternateId and never reads
  // this byte), it does not enter the notify/optimize refusal, and it does
  // not propagate into derived variants. That last one is a call-site
  // convention, not a structural property: the worker's shared write helpers
  // copy source metadata (WriteVariant inherits the flags byte it is
  // handed), and every current caller composes the byte it passes in, none
  // forwarding this bit.
  //
  // One consequence IS observable and is intended: the whole flags byte
  // feeds the weak hit ETag (src/nginx/etag_util.h), so a marked entry does
  // not validate against an otherwise-identical unmarked one.  They are not
