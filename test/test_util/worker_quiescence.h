// Waits for a running Worker to finish the notifications a test sent it,
// decided by what the worker reports rather than by how long it took.
//
// Why this exists: a test that sends a notification and then polls a
// processing counter for a fixed number of seconds is really asserting "the
// optimization finished within N seconds on this host". Image optimization in
// an unoptimized build takes seconds per variant combination on an idle
// machine and many times that on a host whose cores are shared with other
// jobs or under a sanitizer, so every such window is eventually too short,
// and a window that is long enough for the slowest host makes a genuine
// regression cost that long to report. The question the tests actually ask is
// "once the worker has finished with this notification, what did it do?" --
// and the worker can answer when it has finished.
