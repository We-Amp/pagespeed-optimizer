# Self-heal nginx cache ownership before dropping privileges. The proxy cache
# (e.g. the PSI cache backing /analyze) lives on a persisted volume mounted at
# /var/cache/nginx. Two situations leave it unwritable by the worker, which
# runs as the `nginx` user via `user nginx;`:
#   * the volume is created fresh and owned by root, or
#   * a rebuild changes the image's `nginx` UID, orphaning subdirs created by
#     the old UID (mode 0700) — the exact cause of the 2026-06-12 /analyze
#     outage, where UID drifted 101 -> 999 and cache writes failed with
#     `open() ... (13: Permission denied)` -> 500 -> 503.
# This entrypoint runs as root, so chown to the worker user by NAME (resolves
# to whatever UID this image assigns) on every start. The cache is small and
# bounded, so the recursive chown is cheap.
